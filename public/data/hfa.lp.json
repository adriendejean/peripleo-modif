An important witness to the amateur interest in and practice of pharmaceutical medicine by King Henry VIII (b. 1491, d. 1547). Contains a collection of more than 100 medical recipes that have been organised into six sections: plasters; spasmadraps (dipped plasters); ointments; balms; waters, lotions, and decoctions; and cataplasms (poultices). As a number of the recipes indicate, the collection was designed for Henry VIII. This is also suggested by the fact that many recipes provide treatments for easing pain and swelling and cooling inflammation in the legs, and healing leg ulcers, conditions from which Henry VIII suffered following jousting accidents in 1527 and 1536. Over 30 recipes are attributed to the king himself, including one that he apparently devised for Anne of Cleves ('my ladye Anne of Cleve'), queen consort from 6 January to 9 July 1540. Many of the other recipes are attributed to his four royal physicians: William Butts (b. c. 1486, d. 1545) and John Chambre (b. 1470, d. 1549), who are famously depicted with the king on Hans Holbein the Younger's painting Henry VIII and the Barber Surgeons, and Walter Cromer (d. c. 1547), and Augustin de Angustinius (n. d.), a Venetian who was also physician to Cardinal Wolsey. They apparently devised their medical treatments both separately from and collaboratively with one another. The collection suggests that Henry VIII and his physicians predominantly relied on a medieval tradition of herbal, lapidary and chemical remedies. They evidently also subscribed to the medicinal properties of what they believed to be unicorn horn (alicorn). Various recipes, e.g. the Rochestre plastre, Emplastrum de cornubus, Swete Oyntement, Russett Oyntement, Gray plaster, and Unguentum de cornubus, require the use of powdered 'cornu unicornu' or 'unicornis horne'. William Butts also had access to learned medical works since the Italian surgeon Giovanni da Vigo (b. 1450, d. 1525), who published his Practica Copiosa in Arte Chirurgia in 1514, and the Greek physician Galen (129�??199) are cited as his sources. The collection mentions the locations where a number of recipes were devised and put into practice. Henry VIII worked on treatments at Ampthill, Cawood, Fotheringhay, Greenwich, Hampton Court, St James, and Westminster; and the royal physicians worked on theirs at Farnham Castle, Greenwich, St James, the Manor of the More at Ricksmansworth, and Westminster. A number of anonymous recipes are located to still other places: Canterbury, Dover, Knolles, Petworth, and Rochester. These references suggest that Henry VIII and his physicians brought their apothecary equipment with them to the various royal palaces and other residencies they visited. The collection's medical treatments may have been designed over a long period of time: probably between 1536, when Henry VIII's leg condition is thought to have significantly worsened, and 1545, when William Butts died. The fact that the collection is neatly organised into sections with their own tables of contents suggests that it was copied in a single and preplanned undertaking. The reference to Anne of Cleves provides a terminus post quem. This indicates that the manuscript was written between c. 1540 and c. 1545, perhaps for Henry VIII or one of his physicians.

He first entered the navy in 1781 on board the brig, HMS Helena.  He remained with the ship for a short period after which, in 1782,  he left the navy to attend school for three years. He joined the merchant  navy for some years and in 1790, decided to rejoin the Royal Navy. His  first appointment as midshipman was with HMS Hebe. He was later transferred  to the sloop, HMS Tisphone, and followed the Captain, Anthony Hunt, when he   was transferred to HMS Amphitrite in 1793.  In November of that year, he was promoted to Lieutenant and appointed to HMS  Meleager. This ship was part of a squadron off the coast of Genoa under the   command of Captain Horatio Nelson. In August 1796, Hardy transferred to HMS  Minerve with Captain Cockburn. At the end of the year, Nelson transferred to  the Sabina, Hardy, along with Lieutenant Culverhouse, was in charge of a boarding  party sent to claim her as a prize after her capture. They managed to draw off  the rest of the Spanish squadron, but the ship was later re-captured after  one of her masts was destroyed and Hardy was taken prisoner along with the rest  of the boarding party.    He was later repatriated with the Minerve at Gibraltar after an exchange of   prisoners, which included the Captain of the Sabina. Captain Nelson was warm  in praise of the actions of his lieutenants in this action.  Shortly after rejoining his ship, Hardy was nearly captured again by the   Spanish when he jumped overboard to save a seaman who was drowning after   falling out of one of the boats. The current had carried them towards the lead  ship of the Spanish squadron in the Gibraltar Straits. Nelson took instant action  by ordering shorten their sail and stand off. Hardy and the seaman were  rescued. A few days later, the ship had joined the British fleet and took part  in the battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797.  In the following Maym HMSs Minerve and Lively were patrolling around the bay of  Santa Cruz and found a French brig, the Mutine. On the 29th, longboats  from the two ships were sent to capture it under Hardy's command. It  was successful and Hardy was appointed to command of the prize by Admiral  Jervis. He also was promoted to Commander.    Hardy went to the Mediterranean with Nelson, who had been appointed Commander  in Chief. In July 1803, Nelson transferred to HMS Victory and Hardy joined him to   resume his position as Flag Captain.During the following months and years, the  ship was kept busy with the blockade of Toulon and continuing pursuit of the   Franco-Spanish fleet across the Atlantic. Hardy, along with Captain Blackwood,  witnessed Nelson's last will and during the battle of Trafalgar on   October 21st 1805, was walking along side his Commander in chief when a   French spiner fatally shot Nelson. As Nelson's Chief of Staff, he remained  on duty during the remainder of the battle while keeping his dying friend  and Commabder informed of the proceedings. In recognition for these  services, he was created a baronet. He played a major part in the state  funeral of Nelson on 9 January 1806 at St Paul's Cathedral.    Hardy was decorated as a Knight Commander of the Order of Bath in  January 1815 and returned to Britain in June of that year. On his return,  he was appointed to command the Royal Yacht Princess Augusta. He served  on her for three years. In August 1819, he was promoted to Commodore and  appointed as Commander in Chief for the South American station. He  transferred his flag to HMS Superb and his services during the war of  independence that was being fought in the former Spanish colonies won  him praise from the Admiralty. He eventually returned to Britain in 1824.    In 1830, he was appointed as First Sea Lord at the Admiralty. He  retained this post until 1834. During this period, he was appointed  as Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Bath. At the end of his period  as First Sea Lord, he was appointed as Governor of Greenwich Hospital.  During his time as Governor, he introduced many changes to improve the lives  of the pensioners. He was promoted as Vice Admiral in January 1837.  Hardy died on 20th September 1839 and was buried in the mausoleum in the   grounds of Greenwich Hospital. His wife and daughters survived him, but  as he had no male heirs, his baronetcy became extinct."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.00921,51.48202],"certainty":"certain"},"uuid":"b65958dc-2a38-424c-a6ef-1af79722c5f1"},{"type":"Feature","@id":"https://w3id.org/locolligo/English-Visitor-Sites/f56a81cb-295f-4ccf-975f-0a846ca8aa53","properties":{"title":"George Livesey blue plaque","organisation":"Open plaques","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Livesey","description":"George Livesey, Sir    1834 to 1908    Chairman of the South Metropolitan Gas Company and one of Southwark's greatest   industrialists    Gave this building to the People           "},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.06312,51.4824],"certainty":"certain"},"uuid":"f56a81cb-295f-4ccf-975f-0a846ca8aa53"},{"type":"Feature","@id":"https://w3id.org/locolligo/English-Visitor-Sites/a7a5c94c-1557-465c-a967-630c1025a3b6","properties":{"title":"Glengall Wharf, Surrey Canal Walk, and Edison Bell blue plaque","organisation":"Open plaques","description":"Glengall Wharf is now a thriving communal garden growing fruit and vegetables.
