Bowl length 45.98mm; diameter 21.07m; wall thickness 2.58mm. At the base of the bowl is the circular heel. On the flat of the heel is an engraved 'I I' going sideways. Either side of the heel is the maker's mark, on one side is the initial 'H' over a star or sun motif with a dot in the centre, the other side has the initial 'A' above the same motif.Dimensions: Overall length 245mm; weight 140gDr David Higgins notes that: The bowl form is a basic London Type 25 (as per Atkinson and Oswald's 1969 London Typology) which is broadly dated to 1700-1770. Symbol marks on their own were used by a number of London makers.  However, this pipe is unusual because it has an initial over the symbol mark. The combination of a symbol and initials would suggest that this pipe dates to the first half of the 18th century. The maker may possibly be Humphrey Parbatt who received his freedom in 1729 at St George in the East (Oswald 1975: 142), which would narrow the date to c.AD1720-1750.The parallel marks on the heel are also interesting, When a heel is trimmed it normally has marks running from front to back, and not sideways like on this example.

It should be remembered that for much of the 18th Century, the Society held the contract to supply medicinals to the Army and to the Admiralty and this would have included scales, weights, bandages and all the other necessary items as well as medications.The earliest of this type had rather archaic depictions of the Apothecary Symbols and were often stamped with a rose-like sign. Professor Biggs states that &#39;this markmay have some connection with the Apothecaries Company&#39;.It is also interesting to note that these weights did not really seem to replace anything very specific but suddenly appeared and their use seems to have become quite widespread very quickly.It also seems that these weights, though the symbols became a little more standardised, were almost the only ones available for the next 100 or so years until the advent of the commercial Scale Companies in the early 19th Century.&quot;"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.063,51.505],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":0.05,"units":"degrees"}}},"uuid":"9d9b842a-3031-475e-bbba-dd79139a492a"},{"type":"Feature","@id":"https://w3id.org/locolligo/English-Visitor-Sites/5bff069d-edef-45e2-abda-959ba890c78d","properties":{"title":"TOKEN","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme","url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/1016895","description":"A complete Post-Medieval copper-alloy farthing trade token,&nbsp;issued by John Condley of Yarmouth, Norfolk.

The apparent survival of pans as opposed to handles is not surprising since tiny thin strips of lead alloy are unlikely to have been recognised for what they are... Moreover, the pan element is much more likely to have been kept as a serviceable bowl or platter, and at least one was converted to form a whirligig.\"\"Pictorial sources and contemporary recipes suggest that frying pans were used for many kinds of foods and yet the base-metal toy pans only seem to have been cast with fish, reflecting the fact that fresh and dried fish were a staple element of the diet... The mould-makers have clearly made some effort to produce the salient features of a fish, and although some of the anatomical details are highly stylized, most are shown with gills, scales and fins... It is also evident that some attempt has been made to represent different species, and these are partly indicated by shape, size, the presence or absence of barbels and spines and other anatomical details. After the middle of the 18th century, oval pans were generally used for frying fish.\"Reference: Forsyth, H. and Egan, G. 2005. Toys, Trifles and Trinkets.

The maker/makers with the mark IDQ are one of the few who do mark their work. It is unknown who IDQ is/are but the use of a triad of initials rather than the usual single or double letters may suggest a husband and wife or father and son partnership (ibid.). Within the Museum of London's collection of toys the first dated pieces known are those by IDQ which seem to have been produced between 1636 and 1646.The origin of I(D)Q is unknown several toys have been discovered in London but a continental origin has been discussed as examples of I(D)Q's work have been recovered from excavations on the Continent, including Paris and Amsterdam. Egan and Forsyth (2005:441) note that the form, style and decoration of the I(D)Q wares do point to a Low Countries or Continental source. However, more toys made by I(D)Q have been found in London than in Paris or Amsterdam, which may suggest they were made by an immigrant craftsman (ibid: 54). Whatever the origin the geographical spread of these toys indicate cross-continent trade. Egan & Forsyth (2005:442) finish the discussion by saying \"There is still no evidence for the identity and location of this prolific and innovative craftsman in the form of irrefutable documentary evidence or moulds for his products. Only when such material becomes available will it be possible to tie down this most intriguing early toymaker and see his international trade in proper perspective.\"Reference: Forsyth, H. and Egan, G. 2005.

The handle is broken and missing on this example and there is a small section of the the outer rim missing which is probably where the handle was situated.

Toys, Trifles and Trinkets. Base Metal Miniatures from London 1200 to 1800. Unicorn Press, LondonEgan &amp; Forsyth (2005:120-1) write that it is quite common for just the pan without the handle to survive. &quot;Evidently the thin, weak handles were liable to snap off and most have broken at the point of greatest mechanical weakness: at the junction of the pan and the handle. The apparent survival of pans as opposed to handles is not surprising since tiny thin strips of lead alloy are unlikely to have been recognised for what they are... Moreover, the pan element is much more likely to have been kept as a serviceable bowl or platter, and at least one was converted to form a whirligig.&quot;&quot;Pictorial sources and contemporary recipes suggest that frying pans were used for many kinds of foods and yet the base-metal toy pans only seem to have been cast with fish, reflecting the fact that fresh and dried fish were a staple element of the diet... The mould-makers have clearly made some effort to produce the salient features of a fish, and although some of the anatomical details are highly stylized, most are shown with gills, scales and fins... It is also evident that some attempt has been made to represent different species, and these are partly indicated by shape, size, the presence or absence of barbels and spines and other anatomical details. After the middle of the 18th century, oval pans were generally used for frying fish.&quot;Reference: Forsyth, H. and Egan, G. 2005. Toys, Trifles and Trinkets.

It has a lightly dished upper surface and a flat bottom, the upper rim of the dishing is heavily abraded. The bottom is however obscured by a heavy white concretion that maybe the remains of litharge (lead oxide) used in the cupellation process. The cupel has a hard grainy grey fabric.Measurements: 28.63mm in diameter, 19.38mm high and 22.02g in weightDiscussion: Cupels were an integral part of the cuppellation process, in which impure noble metals (mostly gold and silver) were purified with the help of litharge (White 2010, 1). The impure metal would be heated with the litharge where the impure metals would react with the litharge and separate from the noble metals in the melt leaving a small glob or 'regulus' ofnoble metal int he cuple (ibid).It has been suggested that cupels only usually survive in the archaeological record once they've been used, as thanks to the absorbtion of the litharge allows the simple ash fabric to remain solid (White 2010, 2). This process leaves the cupels a dark grey, similar to this example (ibid). Cupels were particularly common in the assaying of metals during the 16th and early 17th century and associated with the mint based at the Tower of London, with a number of used and unusually unused examples recovered from its' grounds (White 2010). It should also be noted that the heavy presence of the jewellery industry (in which ??cuppellation also played a role) in Cheapside and the popularity of alchemy and during the 16th and 17th century may account for some of the cupels recovered from the Thames."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.052,51.504],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":0.05,"units":"degrees"}}},"uuid":"090778d4-80f2-4800-a69f-00cbf73eedad"},{"type":"Feature","@id":"https://w3id.org/locolligo/English-Visitor-Sites/90f5b68e-e3a5-4311-8182-db695d46e7c7","properties":{"title":"TOKEN","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme","url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/977748","description":"A complete, Post-Medieval, uniface, cast, lead token dating to the 16th to 18th Century.Description: The token is decorated on one face with a long cross and a pellet in each quadrant.

Their date range is roughly from 1250 to 1450 (Egan and Pritchard 2002, 22, 116; fig. 11).  For two-part clasps Gilmore (2019, 5-6) suggests a date range of c. 1350-1450.  The dating of three-part clasps with transverse ridges along the sides, from London c. 1270-1450, can be compared with tighter dating in the 14th century for buckles with the same side ridges.  Further dating evidence comes from the composite construction of certain examples with a forked spacer (Egan and Pritchard 2002, 119-120; fig. 78); by analogy with buckles made in this way, they date to the late 14th to early 15th centuries.

Calkins on the heels are rare, and shallow if they exist...The size, width around 100mm, is average for these early shoes - horses were small, of course.It's probably a front shoe - the width and length are about the same, whereas rear shoes are longer than they are wide.

Description: A small, circular, ceramic disc formed from the foot-ring of a Roman vessel of a light orange brown, unglazed fabric.  The disc has a smooth, concave surface with worn, rounded breaks at the base of the now lost sides. On the underside surface are incised circular grooves set within a raised outer edge.Measurements: This gaming piece measures 31.77mm diameter, narrowing to 30.84mm at the base. The internal diameter base: 28.15mm. The walls are irregular in height but its maximum thickness is 11.11mm. It weighs 21.63 grams.Discussion: This object is an example of the secondary use of an object which was originally a fineware, roman bowl. The smooth concave surface was the inner surface of the vessel and the surface with circular grooves, the footring found on the underside of the vessel. Crummy (1983:93) suggests that the most likely use of such objects is as gaming counters. Similar examples are also published from Roman Castleford, (Cool & Philo 1998) which share a similar interpretation though this extends them to possibly counting tokens also.

These consist: possible a leopards head (which is indistinct indicating that it was slightly misstruck); lion rampant; the initials RT with pellets above and below; a hand. Diametrically opposite is the second set of stamps comprising two stamps one with the letter G and the other with the letter F again in elaborate cartouches. These touchmarks are not listed in Cotterell (1929) nor Jackson (1970).Dimensions: diameter: 130.40mm; weight: 70.28g.Cotterell (1929:51-52) writes \"The last type of mark which the maker impressed as referring to himself, and one of the utmost importance from the connoisseur's point of View, is that of the three, four or more-usually four-devices contained in small shields or cartouches, struck in a row and resembling the Hall-mark of the Goldsmiths.For want of a better designation one must it seems follow the general acceptance of the term and call them \"Hall-Marks,\" though nothing was ever more certain than that they were nothing of tire kind, for neither had they connexion with, nor were they in any way recognised by, the Authorities at Pewterers' Hall. On the contrary, the Company was in constant trouble with the Goldsmiths over them, which in 1635 culminated' in the Court of Aldermen forbidding their use by the Pewterers. This order may have been observed temporarily, but Chap. VI is full of instances of its being flagrantly disobeyed later in the same century.One of the earliest instances of their use is that of Nicholas Kelk (No. 2704, g.'U.), who was a Freeman of the Company as early as 1641 (probably earlier). He would therefore have full knowledge of this ruling of the Court of Aldermen in 1635. The fact however remains that, from c. 1675 onwards, the Pewterers used these \"Hall-marks\" quite freely, without let or hindrance, so long as they were accompanied by their proper touches.On early examples the \"Hall-Mark \" is found on the front of a plate or dish, generally on the rim but occasionally in the well, with the maker's touch on the back, and this method would seem to have obtained until the second quarter of the eighteenth century, but from this period onwards it was the custom to stamp all these marks on the back, in the centre. It is a most unusual thing to find a piece, of later date than about 1735, with the \"Hall-Marks\" on the front.Turning to the speculative side of these \"Hall-Marks.\" So long as the initials in them are the same as in the maker's touch, all is easily understandable, but this does not by any means always happen; eg. John Home, No. 2393, who used a \"Hall-Mark wherein the initials \"S.S\" appear. This \"Hall-Mark\" is known to be that of Samuel Smith, No. 4 3 79. The question we have to answer is - Which of the two made the piece?In the remarks which follow reference must be understood to London pewterers only, for if we turn to country craftsmen, we find \" confusion worse' confounded,\" and m such cases as those of the Duncombs ; Birch 85 Villers ; Yates & Birch ; .Yates, Berh 8: Spooner; James Yates, etc., the intermingling of such marks leaves but little hope of an ultimate unravelling.\"Reference: Hornsby, P., Weinstein, R. and Homer, R. 1989.

The reverse has a central short cross pattee with a ring and dot in each angle surrounded by a border of oblique rays. The oblique rays run in a clockwise direction upon both faces suggesting a London rather than Paris origin. Mitchiner and Skinner (1984:94) write \"a significant number of 'cross and pellets' tokens have been recovered alongside coins of Henry VII, suggesting that they remained in use until the beginning of the sixteenth century.

But several specimens illustrated by Forgeais (Paris provenance) show different orientations of the ray border on obverse and reverse.The dominant series of 'cross and pellets' tokens bears a dot-in-circle in each angle of the cross and typically has a clockwise ray border and also expanded ends to the arms of the cross. Diverging from this standard form one can observe a number of variants. Tokens bearing a single dot in each angle of the cross normally have an anti-clockwise ray border and a cross with straight arms. Tokens made of pewter, a late characteristic, also all have an anti-clockwise ray border. This anti-clockwise form of ray border which is, so far as one can judge, a late evolutionary form also occurs on nearly all tokens which have three pellets in each angle of the cross. One should emphasise that although these observations may help to define evolutionary tendencies, they do not demarcate any exclusive class of token.\"References: Mitchiner, M. and Skinner, A. 1984.

The bezel is 14mm in length, and 12.6mm in width. The front of the bezel is worn and depicts a heart pierced by two arrows in saltire, surmounted by a crown. There is a very small rounded symbol in each angle of the arrows, except the angle filled by the crown. These are probably intended to be drops of blood, making it a bleeding heart design. The remains of the pipe tamper protrude from the hoop at the opposite end of the ring's bezel. It consists of circular collared joint which flares out to a further larger circular section. It is then joined to a solid circular screw mechanism which is formed of four circular grooves which ends in an old break. The pipe tamper has a dark grey patina.

This is not true and numerous experiments conducted with a professional potter have demonstrated that it is not possible to make marbleized pottery this way. In order to create the marbling effect the potter must pour the slips (both red and white in this case) onto a surface that has been covered with a red slip (barbottina) that is still wet. This is necessary because of a particular technical aspect which, for the creation of a marbling effect, requires that the vessel be wet and the slips quite fluid so that they can run across the surface to be decorated. If the surface is too dry, instead of flowing across the vessel, the slips will condense and be immediately absorbed by the porous surface of the earthenware, thus creating spots and blotches rather than the smooth, flowing lines characteristic of marble, agate and the other semi-precious stones.\" She continues \"Like maiolica and like most of the other types of slipware, marbleized pottery required two firings. Except for a few mould made shapes from Montelupo, mentioned previously, the vessel was thrown on a wheel (some of the more complex shapes from Montelupo may have been made using both techniques). When it was dry, it was covered with slip, red or white depending on the type, and then the other coloured slips were poured on it and made to flow across the surface by means of the rapid rotating motions, back and forth, left and right, made by the potter who was holding the vessel in his hands. When the decoration was completed, the vessel was fired for the first time; after the first firing it was entirely covered with a transparent lead glaze and fired for a second time. In some cases, this glaze is completely colourless, while in others it tends to be quite yellow so that the white slip underneath it appears as a creamy ivory colour.\"References: Moore Valeri A., 2013.

The name is also indifferently spelt, as you know, at that period. No one was permitted to issue these Borough tokens but the Corporation. There was no restriction as to tradespeople issuing their own farthings or tokens, beyond the requirement that the metal or material used, whether lead, pewter, or brass, should of itself fully represent the value of the farthing, under a penalty of forfeiting the whole of them, and a fine of 20s.

The end of the terminal has been decoratively cast to form a gryphon (griffin) or mythical beast. During the Medieval period the drinking horn began to be associated with griffins and is often referred to as Greifenklauen \"because, in popular imagination, the colossal mythical griffin or gryphon had the hind parts of a lion and the foreparts of an eagle, and so large horns were frequently preserved as the talons or claws of this legendary beast. Indeed, it was claimed that their rarity was inevitable because only a saint or a very holy man could obtain one in exchange for curing the griffin of some wound or sickness.\"John Mandeville in his 14th century book 'The Travels of Sir John Mandeville' chapter xxix writes about the land of Bacharia \"In that country be many griffins, more plenty than in any other country. Some men say that they have the body upward as an eagle and beneath as a lion; and truly they say sooth, that they be of that shape. But one griffin hath the body more great and is more strong than eight lions, of such lions as be on this half, and more great and stronger than an hundred eagles such as we have amongst us. For one griffin there will bear, flying to his nest, a great horse, if he may find him at the point, or two oxen yoked together as they go at the plough. For he hath his talons so long and so large and great upon his feet, as though they were horns of great oxen or of bugles or of kine, so that men make cups of them to drink of.

This is a Poole Group A Type 1c tile. The tile would have covered the ridge line of the roof of a high-status building. The tile is semi-circular in section with four triangular knife cut crests running along the apex of the tile.Dimensions: length: 190mm; width: 100.20mm; thickness: 17mm; weight: 881g.Another crested ridge roof tile on the database is IOW-88F5C8.Poole (2010:11) writes \"A range of different crest forms were identified and were divided into twelve types (figs.4-16). These can be broadly grouped into hand made (Group D: types 4 moulded and 12 thumb-pressed), cut triangular (Group A: types 1, 2, 3 truncated triangle, 8 asymmetric triangle), pyramidal (Group C: type 11) and applied strip with knife stabbing (Group B: types 5 scalloped with aperture, 6 triangular with aperture, 7 individual triangles, 9 solid strip).Some of the forms have identical or close parallels from previous excavations in Southampton: triangular varieties equivalent to type 1 are common (Platt and Coleman-Smith 1975 fig 216. 1416 fig. 217 nos 1429, 1432, 1433). There was one example comparable to type 1b with the base of the crest pierced by a small perforation from High Street, Southampton (Platt and Coleman-Smith 1975 fig. 216 no. 1422) and examples have also been found in Winchester (Poole and Shaffrey, ibid). The most conspicuous are those equivalent to type 5, 6 and 9 (Platt and Coleman-Smith 1975 fig. 214 no. 1407, 1408, 1409).Ridge tiles with knife cut triangular crests are the more usual form and they exhibit considerable variation in size. They have been found at Winchester (Poole and Shaffrey ibid) and were in use at Portchester Castle from the early 13th century through to the post-medieval period. Tiles of this sort were being produced at the Laverstock kilns, though only one of exactly the same height was identified. However, there was limited evidence at Laverstock of 'loop-handled' crest probably equivalent to the type 5 crests. However, since this type is not common outside of Southampton it is more likely to reflect influence from Southampton reaching Laverstock through merchants trading between Southampton and the West country via Salisbury (VCH Wilts vi, 126).The largest number of crested ridge tiles occur in the high medieval phase reflecting their predominance in the 13th to 14th century. A small number (with crest types 1, 5 and 6) found in Anglo-Norman contexts suggests production commenced in the early 13th century. There is a decrease in the late and post- medieval periods, indicating crested ridge tiles continued in use, but it is unclear whether this form of tile was still being produced. An unglazed example with small pyramidal spurs (type11) and a type 1 with incised lines radiating from the spur crest, both from the post-medieval phase of tenement 237 may be late forms. The numbers of any particular crest type are too few to ascertain whether certain varieties were produced at a particular period.\"References: Poole, C. 2010.

In 1656 half penny tokens were introduced. 1674 by Royal decree production of trade tokens ceased. Pers comm Verity AnthonyBerry (1997) writes \"Canteens have been an integral part of British army life for the lower ranks since time immemorial. They certainly existed in the middle of the seventeenth century, being run then by \"sutlers\", who supplied the troops with food, drink and tobacco to supplement the meagre rations doled out by the military. Sutlers were civilians. The word is derived from the Dutch and means a small vendor or petty tradesman. An army ordinance of December 31, 1590, states, \"The Provost Marechal and Sergeant-Major of every garrison shall keep a perfect roll of all such English victuallers called in Dutch sutlers, petty merchants and other loose persons of the English nation.\" William Shakespeare alludes to them in his line, \"I shall sutler be unto the Campe and profits will accrue.\" (Henry V). They seem to have had a particular association with guards' regiments. The London Gazette of 1701 refers to a Mr Wollaston, sutler at Ye Horse Guards.Sutlers had an important role to play in the everyday life of the guards, as J. W. Fortescue points out, \"There was no such thing as an Army Service Corps until the end of the nineteenth century, and all the business of transport and supply was done by contract. In that old battleground of the Coldstream, the Low Countries, a contractor could always be found who knew the business thoroughly. But the contractor was concerned only with the bread and fuel. Everything else was a regimental matter conducted by their regimental sutler, which meant more stoppages, more financial regulations and more accounts. Incidentally, this arrangement must have been bad for discipline, for the soldier who had to pay for his ration of meat, had great temptation to lay violent hands upon every fowl, pig or sheep that came his way. It is worthwhile to note that in the regimental sutler lay the germ of the regimental canteen.\"\"Berry (1997) continues \"Two sutlers' tokens, at least, are directly connected with the other contemporary Guards' regiment, Monk's regiment of foot, which after the Battle of Dunbar had its headquarters at Cold-stream on the Tweed. After the Restoration, the men of this regiment were mustered on Tower Hill and ordered to lay down their arms. Within minutes they were instructed to take them up again, this time as the King's Second Regiment of Foot Guards. The men refused to accept their new designation, insisting that they were second to none! They were then ordered to take up arms as the Lord-General's Regiment of Foot Guards. This remained the regiment's title until 1670, when it became known officially as the Coldstream Guards.General Monk, newly created Duke of Albemarle, had been allotted the post of Lord General of all the forces in England, Scotland and Ireland by the House of Commons in February 1660. A sutler's token issued at the Tilt Yard actually shows a bust of the Duke of Albemarle on the obverse. Although the bust is not clear, its identity is in no doubt as the initials, D. A., appear on either side. The obverse and reverse legends, if joined together as the engraver intended, read, RICHARD WASHBOURNE AT THE TILT YARD SVTTLER 1666 HIS HALFE PENNY R.A.W.Stowe, in his Survey of London of 1598 writes, \"The Leper's Hospital of St James's was surrendered to Henry VIII and the King then built a goodly manor annexing thereunto a park, closed about with a wall of brick now called St James Park, serving indifferently to the said manor and to the manor or palace of Whitehall. South from Charing Cross on the right are divers fair houses lately built before the park, then a large tilt yard for noblemen and others to exercise themselves in jousting, turning and fighting of barriers.\" Thus, St James's Park occupies the site of Henry's tilt yard. Records of both guards' regiments show that troops were regularly kept in the Tilt Yard. In 1699 we read, \"guards were kept at Kennington, Hyde Park, Acton Road, Arlington Gate, Tilt Yard St James, Whitehall, Somerset House, Hampton Court and Windsor, and the allowance for fire and candle paid to Colonel John Shrimpton commanding the First Regiment of Guards.\" In my view, Richard Washbourne provided a canteen service for the Lord General's Regiment of Guards under canvas in St James's Park. At this time, there were few permanent barracks. Soldiers were either provided with tented accommodation or boarded out in private lodgings.\"London County Council (1935:6) write \"In course of time a large proportion of the accommodation at the Horse Guards became used for purposes other than at first intended. A report (fn. n20) by Sir Christopher Wren, dated 4th March, 1712-3, states that stabling had originally been provided for 108 horses, but that at that time there was only room for 62 horses, accommodation for the remaining 46 being used by the sutler at the south end (room for 11 horses), the Paymaster's house and offices at the north-west corner (30 horses), and the Judge Advocate (fn. n21) on the west side (5 horses).\"Reference: Williamson, G.

Having succeeded in this endeavor, in August of 1688 they asked to expand the project to include the \"American Plantations,\" that is, the American colonies. Richard Holt, who acted as the agent for a number of tin mine owners, petitioned the King for the right to produce American Plantations tokens. Holt's petition is extant but we do not have a copy of the royal patent granting him permission to actually produce and distribute the coins. It may be the patent was never granted or simply that it is lost.Unfortunately, without the patent we cannot be sure of the status of these coins. We do know on June 26, 1688 Holt requested the use of Skinner Hall and the use of the minting presses and tools which were there to produce his patterns. This was where James II had produced his regal tin farthings for domestic use. The domestic production had been completed and the lease on the hall was not due to expire until August 8th of that year (subsequently the lease was renewed). Holt employed the engraver John Roettier to design and cut dies for this American Plantations token. On July 27, 1688 Holt sent a letter to the Lord Commissioners of the Treasury with pattern examples of the coin for the King's approval. On August 13th the Commissioners sent the examples to the Officers of the Royal Mint for comment. There are no records after this. We do know that production was started for examples from seven different sets of dies exist. The coins were composed of 97.5% pure tin with an average weight of 135 grains. However, we do not know if the pieces were ever approved or if they were ever shipped to the colonies. Eric Newman has summarized the problem quite well as follows:It is therefore somewhat doubtful whether the circulation of the Plantations farthings was formally approved as no record to that effect has been found. It is also possible that even if approval had been obtained the few remaining months of the reign of James II had elapsed before distribution in America had been planned or carried out. Even though many pieces were struck in anticipation of formal approval and actual distribution it is unsound to conclude that any reached America until evidence of their circulation in the American plantations is found. [Newman, 1964, p. 324]On November 5, 1688 William of Orange landed in England to fight for his claim to the throne. On December 11, 1688 James II fled to France and on January 28, 1689 he was declared to have abdicated the throne and William III and Mary were proclaimed King and Queen. No doubt this abdication precluded either the authorization or the dissemination for any coinage bearing the image of James II, including the American Plantations tokens.Interestingly, this token was not denominated in pence but was valued at 1/24 of a Spanish real, which, in the colonies, would have equalled one and one half farthings. This was done because of the predominance of Spanish coinage in the colonies and the hope that it would improve acceptance of the new coin. In British documents discussing the production of this piece it is generally referred to as a \"farthing.\"The obverse of the coin shows James II on horseback with the legend, IACOBVS . II . D G . MAG . BRI . FRAN . ET . HIB . REX . (James II by the grace of God King of Great Britain, France and Ireland). On the reverse are the four crowned shields of England, Scotland, France and Ireland (clockwise from top) linked together with chains and the legend, VAL . 24 PART . REAL . HISPAN . (translated as: Value a 24th part of a Spanish real). Beads similar to those found on the obverse and reverse rim were added to the edge. Eric Newman has identified seven obverse (1-7) and seven reverse (A-G) dies used for the American Plantations token. The combinations are 1-A, 2-B, 2-G, 3-C, 4-D, 4-E, 5-D, 6-F and 7-F. The differences in the obverses are primarily based on the specific position of the head in relation to the letters in the legend while the reverses are distinguished by the number of strings on the harp (A has 6 strings, B has 7, C has 8, D has 11, E has 7, F has 6 and G has 5). Newman reverse die C has a sideways 4 and Newman reverse die G has the Irish harp and Scottish lion rampant shields transposed. A and F can be distinguised in that the lowest lion's head is left of the two others on A and to the right on F. Varieties 1-A, 2-G, and 3-C are very rare.In 1828 the London coin dealer Matthew Young obtained many of the Roettier dies. He then sold most of the coin and metal dies to the British Museum. Among these dies he apparently acquired and retained two pairs of the original American Plantations token dies as well as the bars used to make the beaded edge. From these dies he produced a few hundred restrikes in a pewter based metal. The majority of the restrikes are 5-D but he also made some examples of 4-D and 4-E. Besides the metal composition restrikes can be identified in that they are usually in much better condition that the original tokens. Tin is a poor metal for coins in that it corrodes easily, especially in colder climates. Most of the restrikes (made with obverse 5) show a break in the die on the obverse as in the example on the following page.\"Information also found at http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/AmPlant.intro.html"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.028,51.497],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":0.05,"units":"degrees"}}},"uuid":"a6d14f47-ea43-4ccb-879e-099488a902a5"},{"type":"Feature","@id":"https://w3id.org/locolligo/English-Visitor-Sites/8716b922-6c3d-44f7-9f0a-9df0d1d199d2","properties":{"title":"DISH","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme","url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/853351","description":"A Medieval to Post Medieval lead alloy (pewter) small dish, probably dating to the 15th-17th century.

Lewis (2014:145) writes \"The relic of St John the Baptist's head on a charger inspired the design of many pilgrim badges associated with his cult at Amiens. The form of charger probably explains their circular form. Upon them is the image of the forward-facing head of St John the Baptist. \"Over-large, protruding eyes\" are a feature of such badges, which Brian Spencer suggests might betray roots in the \"popular belief that a saint with a menacing look and with huge, staring eyes, would give better protection against infections and other ailments by repelling evil spirits\".

The fragment consists of an eight-spoked wheel, with a driver sitting above. Another piece of the toy protrudes from the lower-right edge of the wheel, probably part of the stand, however it is bent backwards behind the wheel. The wheel has a raised pellet in the centre and where each spoke meets the wheel hoop. The driver is right-facing, dressed in a broad, cocked hat and long coat and has it's arms extrented outwards holding the reigns. There is a moulded-relief decoration on the driver, consisting of buttons, an arm, facial features and clothing outlines. The protruding part from the lower-right side of the wheel, presumably the stand, is inscribed with the letter H with a horizontal line above and below, probably indicating the maker. This letter is on the rear side, however due to this part being bent backwards it is visible from the front-side on the toy.This example appears to have been part of a flat, two-dimensional version of a toy horse and carriage.

These finds consist of simple bowls and basins with a curled rim and a particular type of pilgrim's flask with four loops on the sides that British scholars call lion-headed costrels (Hurst et al 1986, 37, Berti 1997, 376, Tipo Cc 2 and g. 33/4) (Figure 2).\"Blake (1981:105) writes \"So far few marbled closed forms have been found in north Tuscany and Liguria.

The snuffer comprises of two arms held together with a copper-alloy rivet, which avts as a pivot. The arms have broken just above the rivet, but would have extended further, resembling handles on a pair of scissors. The arms are rectangular-section, with the lower arm having an extinguishing tray that projects upwards. The tray rises at 90 degrees from the arm, before constricting inwards on both sides, then flaring out slightly again before leading to a rounded upper part. It has wide walls that correspond with the full width of the object. The lower arm then narrows abrutly, leading to a sharp point. The upper arm is also rectangular-section, starting as wide as the lower arm but slowly tapering into a sharp point. This arm fits neatly under the extinguising tray, as the inner-edge of the tray does not meet the lower arm and pointed end of the upper arm only extends as far as the other end of the tray, allowing the upper arm to cleanly rotate around the pivot.A similar example is recorded on the database: SUR-3D1C1E, with a suggested date of AD1600-1800.Dimensions: length: 79.27mm; width: 29.58mm; thickness: 9.60mm; weight: 41.12g"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.062,51.5],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":0.05,"units":"degrees"}}},"uuid":"79df44af-15cb-4de9-8072-5047c2f26794"},{"type":"Feature","@id":"https://w3id.org/locolligo/English-Visitor-Sites/b61cd781-c93a-4ecf-97ac-88d6a2fdf46f","properties":{"title":"JETTON","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme","url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/816792","description":"A Post Medieval copper-alloy jetton of Wolf Lauffer II (AD 1612-1651).

The reverse shows a hand between the initials B/F within a circular border made of small cross symbols. The initials probably indicate that the manufacturer was Bernaert Foncq (before 1658). A similar example has been recorded on the database: SOM-AC7D56.The Lion was issued from 1454-60 in Burgundy by Philip the Good (1419-67) and weighed 4.25g. It continued in circulation however and a century later in 1583-4, the Flanders lion (4.14g) was issued on the same design. The lion on the reverse suggests the weight could be for one of several coins: Philip the Good of Burgundy (1419-1467) struck a lion which weighed 4.25 grams and its fractions (2/3rds -2.83 grams - and 1/3rd -1.41 grams-) between 1454-1460. In 1583-1584 the Flanders lion was struck along with its half, this lion weighed 4.14 grams.

This inscription is recorded in the 1674 edition of Loues Garland, or Posies for Rings, Hand-Kerchers and Gloues by N.O. for John Spencer (Evans 1931: 49).  A signet ring in the collection of the British Museum (reference AF.832) features a roughly similar maker's mark, and is tentatively attributed to Howell Dossett, a freeman of the Goldsmith's Company active in the mid 17th century.References: Evans.

The object is circular and has a flat flange, shallow curving wall and a flat, rounded base. The front of the plate/charger has a raised, moulded-relief decoration, comprising of a scrolling foliate design around the flange and a beaded edge. The base is decorated with a trapezoidal basket or flower pot, which itself has a hatch decoration and a pellet on each of the four corners, and has foliage rising from within. This is all within a circular, beaded border which has lines radiating from its outer edge towards the flange. The reverse side is undecorated. The toy has been crushed and deformed so it is hard to determine how deep the wall would have been, however the narrow space between the decoration on the flange and the base would suggest it would have been fairly shallow. It has an overall golden-brown colour, which is the result of tin sulphide discoloration from the Thames, also known as \"nature's gilding\".No exact parallels could be found in Forsyth & Egan (2005) or on the database. Forsyth & Egan (2005:no.8.66 and 8.80-8.81) show examples with a similar style of decoration on the base, all of which have an 18th century date. The flange decoration however is similar to no.8.44, although this example doesn't have a decorated base, and has a date of AD1680-1700. None of the 17th century plates/chargers illustrated in Forsyth & Egan (2005) have a similarly decorated base. Taking this into account, this example appears to more closely resemble the 18th century designs, rather than no.844 of an earlier date, so it is likely to date to the 18th century.Dimensions: diameter: 48.69mm; width of flange: 8.69mm; thickness: 1.14mm; weight: 8.41g Reference: Forsyth, H. and Egan, G. 2005.

The style of the chair is similar to Thomas Chippendale's ribband back chairs of this time period. The object consists of the back of the chair and seat cast in one piece, with the legs missing. The back stiles are semi-circular in section and initially protrude from the seat vertically, then curve outwards towards the top rail, meeting it at a corner. The top rail is double curved (upwards) with an ellipse. There is a circular motif in both corners of the top rail and at the top of the ellipse. The splat (vertical central element of a chair back) has a symetrical, ribbon style design. It consists of 2 bars connected to the back of the seat at a v-shape, which taper inwards and then curve outwards to form a sub-circular shape in the centre of the splat. The bars then taper inwards again to a point of meeting, with the ends of the bars flaring slightly outwards. Within the sub-circular shape created, there is a pierced lozenge shape with each of the corners connected to the sub-circle shape. The centre sub-circle is connected to the stiles of the chair by two vertical bars on either side. There is another bar on either side which connects the upper part of the stile to the ellipse, bending at a corner to avoid meeting the flare on the splat design. The seat of the chair is trapezoidal in plan, with the front and both sides bent over at almost right-angles. On the front bend there are two stumps where the front two legs, now missing, once connected. The back of the chair is bent upright to approximately 120 degrees from the seat. The splat and stiles are decorated with a molded-relief design consisting of a beaded design on the splat and top rail, and four-pelleted flower motifs within a circle on the stiles. There is a flower motif where the vertcial bars join the central sub-circular shape. The seat of the chair is decorated with a repeated pattern comprising of lozenges in a grid pattern. Each lozenge has a pellet in the centre. The decoration of the seat may be representing a cushion, as examples of the chairs the toy is likely to be copying have a cushioned seat (Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection). This decoration continues onto the front bend. The object is a dark grey colour with golden patches which are the result of tin sulphide discoloration from the Thames, also known as \"nature's gilding\".A similar style of chair is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection: Accession number: 64.101.983, .984, with a date of AD1755-1760.

There is a maker's mark located on the spoon bowl directly below the handle. The makers mark appears to consist of a crown over a letter I or J within a circle. The mark isn't listed in Jackson (1970). The bowl of the spoon has been flattened and bent in places, and has been bent backwards from the stem.

It has suffered damage to the outer border edge with some parts of it now missing; the central field containing George and the dragon remains predominantly intact.It measures 41.58mm (length) x 31.94mm (width) x 0.81mm (thickness) and weighs 3.7g.These foil badges would have been sewn directly on to clothing, as can be seen on this example with needle-pierced holes around the border.

The spoon is complete with bowl, stem and figurative terminal. The figure at the top of the spoon is cast and stands on a small dais or column (made from the top of the stem which is oval in section). The figure is roughly oval in plan and sub-oval in cross section. The figure is dressed in a loose fitting gown holding a cup or chalice. The earliest dated set of Apostle Spoons is 1493 AD, but they were most popular from 1500 AD to 1660's AD. Complete sets consisted of all twelve Apostles and the Saviour or the Virgin Mary. They were commonly given as Christening gifts, either as a full set by the wealthy or just as a single spoon by the less affluent. For the most part, these spoons were made individually. Wealthy grandparents would buy one spoon representing a babies \"apostle\" and it would be their Christening present. This spoon would be used only by that person and it would be kept for life. Consequently most of the old apostle spoons show considerable wear both at the finial and at the bowl. The phrase \"to be born with a silver spoon\" stems from this tradition. Initially they were made from silver, but examples made from pewter or copper alloy are known.

The book clasp is rectangular and formed of one sheet, with a flared rivet attachment end and a hook at the other end. The flared end widens to form a stretched trapezoid with six removes of different shapes from the outer edge. At the flared end of the object, there are 2 rivets of the same alloy still intact. The front surface is decorated with an engraved linear pattern comprising 3 isoceles triangles, with a remove being at the centre-bottom of each triangle, pointing towards the middle of the clasp from the expanded end. Each triangle has a line down its centre, with diagonal lines either side pointing towards the remove. 3 lines flare out from either side of the middle triangle towards the centre, and a parallel line runs down the outside edge of both outside triangles. At the hooked end of the clasp, there are two parallel engraved lines running from top to bottom of the object. Several other lines run perpendicular to the inner of these 2 lines, pointing towards the middle of the clasp, and get gradually shorter towards the middle of the midline of the clasp. A rivet of the same alloy is still intact at the end of these shortest lines. At the tip of each triangle, a hole appearing to be for decoration, which is wider at the opening end, has been punched into the object. The centre of the plate is decorated with a concentric circle with a central hole.The back-plate of the clasp is still intact with one rivet (towards the hooked end of the clasp) keeping it in place. The plate is undecorated. The object is yellow brass coloured, with darker patches in places. A similar book fitting can be found in Norwich (Margeson 1993: 74-75 no. 453) and is dated to the late 16th century.

The obverse of the coin is poorly executed image of a laureate head, the features are large and lack any definition. There are crude letters in the border forming a legend but again they are large and the legend is nonsensicle. The reverse appears to have a stylised crown in the center, shape like the letter B laid sideways and surrounded by pellets. The object is cast as a mould line is visible around the edge of the coin which is of irregular thickness, essentially wedge shaped in section.The object has been examined by Dr. Sam Moorhead and Dr. Vincent Drost, British Museum, who are confident that the coin is not Roman nor even an ancient copy. The material suggests a later forgery of 'Billy and Charley' who began using copper alloys,so called 'cock metal' a Copper/lead (2/1) mix to make their forgeries by AD1864 (Halliday 1986). The object has a dark olive green colour consistent with a copper alloy. The surface of the object is pitted and uneven. It is not known quite how many forgeries were produced by Billy and Charley between AD.1857-1871 but estimates are between 5000-10,000 and they seem to have favoured forging predominantly medieval objects.

This aglet is an openwork design where there are two rows of lozenges with a solid band between, at the end there is another solid band with the same decoration and a solid cap terminal. It is possible there was a solid band above the final row of lozenges that is now missing. The lozenges are made from a lozenge-shaped piece of sheet gold with filigree work (twisted gold wire) around the edge forming a cell. It is possible there was another material inlaid in the middle, however there is no evidence remaining. The two solid bands are decorated again with filigree work, this time comprising wire that has been coiled to form a spiral and this is laid on its side forming a raised pattern. There are similar solid bands with this coiled filigree work on LON-EA7160, LON-0D052B and LON-E7ED18 which were found associated with this object. The distal end is closed by a solid cap that is a decorated with a filigree six-petalled flower (comprising twisted gold wire forming six pointed ovals radiating from a central pellet, there is a twisted wire ring forming a border around the central pellet). This end cap is similar to LON-E7ED18 however that example is open work rather than solid. The aglet is damaged and squashed distorting the overall shape, sections of the upper row of lozenges are missing and the upper edge of the aglet also appears to be missing.Dimensions: length: 14.80mm; width: 7.50mm; thickness: 3.81mm; weight: 0.41g.As the aglet is greater than 300 years old and is more than 10% gold it fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act 1996.This aglet was found at the same time and in the same place as LON-811333, a filigree circular decorative element.

The mounts are of a range of shapes and all have incised decoration on one side only. They probably come from a box and have evidence on the reverse of file marks, used to ensure they were secure. All have a dark brown pattination and are in various states of completeness.1. The square mount has a central circular perforation, which probably would have contained a rivet. There is an engraved circle running around the perforation with a cross extending outwards from it, the ends meeting the edges of the mount. In between the cross arms are further radiating lines of different lengths, with a peak in the middle.2. The trapezoidal mount has a rounded rectangular perforation along one of the longest edges. Either side of the perforation are double vertical lines. This mount was likely from the hinge or handle section of the box based on the shape of the perforation. There is a crack at one of the shortest edges and another forming at the opposite end.3. The rectangular mount has a single engraved line at one of the shortest edges, with a double line engraved slightly further down. Beneath the lines is a carved foliate design that appears to resemble a willow tree. However, the decoration would have continued onto another panel so it is difficult to discern the entire design. There is also a break at one of the corners of the end with linear decoration. This piece is slightly bent due to extensive deposition in water.4. The complete asymmetrical mount consists of a rounded shaped section with a knop at the end and a collar separating it from an elongated oval shaped section. The second section tapers before forking out either side of a pointed oval terminal. The engraved decoration is very worn but, upon comparison with the other similar pieces, appears to be a foliate design.5. Part of an almost identical mount to number four, consisting of a round and elongated oval section separated by a collar. The decoration of the collar is more pronounced in this example, consisting of a double engraved line with diagonal lines running through the centre. The foliate design appears across the rest of this piece. There is a break at either end of the mount, but it is highly likely this would have been the same size and shape as mount four.6. This mount is very similar to mounts four and five. It consists of an elongated oval section, tapering at one end before flaring out again, with a rounded knop at the opposite end. The mount is decorated in a foliate design, which appears to show branches in the centre with the outline of the canopy formed by dashed lines running around the branches. The mount is broken at the flaring end, so it's original shape and size is unclear.7. The pointed oval terminal of a similar mount to four, five and six. It is possible that this fragment belongs to either five or six, though it does not fit the break on either. There is a carved line at the broken end with a radiating design, the longest line being in the centre. It appears this piece is also following the foliate decoration on the other pieces.Many similar mounts have been found on the foreshore in front of the Tower of London, often dated to the later Medieval period. However, the identification of a figural mount found in the same vicinity depicting a man wearing late 16th or early 17th century dress (LON-2F1FB2) suggests these are more likely to be later in date.

The barrel is cylindrical, faceted at one end to form three panels on the top. The barrel tapers from the faceted end to the centre and flares to the muzzle. There is part of the iron firing mechanism still connected to the barrel at the faceted end. The mechanism is rectangular with a broken rectangular projection at the top and a semi-circular indentation below. The edges of this iron mechanism are worn, showing a laminated texture beneath. At the muzzle end of the barrel are two projections, an oval projection at the top and squared projection beneath. Underneath the faceted section are three maker's marks and a circular perforation where the handle of the pistol would have attached. The maker's marks are the initials \"A.G.\", \"L.LIBRE\" and three equal armed crosses beneath a foliate design with a crown above. Next to the A.G. mark there appears to be the word \"Vil\" scratched in a much cruder style to the decoration. Other than the breaks on the iron projection there is damage on the base of the barrel, which is squared and appears to have been caused by scraping. It is unlikely this is an attachment that has fallen off as the edges of the break are unclean. There are minor scratches across the surface and patches of mid-dark brown discolouration along the barrel. The rest of the barrel has a golden pattination.The barrel is decorated on the facets with a double engraved line separating the panels from the rest of the barrel and a further line roughly 4mm down the barrel. The panels are separated with linear engravings and there are swirls or semi-circles at the ends of the panels. Within the panels are various foliate motifs, with the central panel having what appears to be an axe and scythe, crossed in the centre, with an overlying helmet bearing the letter W. As the decoration is not machined the foliate motifs on each panel vary significantly.No parallels for this example can be found, but flintlock pistols with faceted barrels appear in the 18th century, and often come from continental manufacturers.

The body is formed of a single sheet of copper alloy which has been bent and soldered at the edges. The lid and base appear to have been cast, with the based soldered to the body with lead alloy. Some traces of the lead alloy remain on the inside of the vessel. The lid connected to the tin by a hinge along one side formed of three loops on the body and two on the lid, with an axial pin connecting them. The lid is now separate, with one of loops and part of the axial pin missing. The lips of the base and lid have are thick and ribbed. The object is in very good condition, with some damage to the edges and wear on the decorated surfaces.The tin is decorated on the outside only. The body is covered in a foliate design on each of the longer sides, depicting what appears to be two laurel fronds overlapping. The lid and base appear to have the same decoration within an oval border running around the edge of the plate. The decoration is formed of a series of a panels; a central large panel and three panels at the ends. The upper and lower panels on the ends have a wave decoration with hatching in the blank space. There appears to be writing in the middle end panels, illegible now except for the odd word, which would have been a moral motto or rhyme. The central decoration on both sides depicts a scene in a tavern, where a man sits at a table with a woman on his knee and another individual serving. On the lid a woman is serving, with a beaker, and on the base a man is serving and appears to have dropped a plate. The woman sitting on the man's knee is holding a beaker in both and there is a flagon on the table. There is detailing in the brickwork behind, the floor and windows on the back wall.There are no exact parallels for this example but based on the inscription and construction of the object it is likely dated to the 18th century and Dutch in origin (Hazel Forsyth, pers. comm.).

There is a break on the domed end where the tip of the syringe would have been, leaving a sub-circular hole. The break at the tip is not clean and the tip has been pinched so that the hole is not its original shape. Above the tip is a double collar, with an identical double collar half way along the barrel. Decorating the object are two double pairs of engraved lines running around the barrel between the central collars and the tip and the central collars and the flange. These pairs are evenly spaced along the barrel. Further decorations appear to have been added at a later stage, in the form of engraved lines radiating from the central collar towards the tip. There are further irregular scratches across the surface of the object but they appear to be accidental. There is evidence of zinc corrosion at the open end of the object, with a white crystalline structure having formed around the rim. There is also Thames sediment in the barrel itself.

The knife consists of a blade which is thick along one edge, tapering to the blade edge, and tapering from tang to tip. The tang is squared and tapers to the break, making it unclear what type of terminal the tang had. The handle, which would have been made of bone or wood, is no longer present. There is a large lump of concretion at the junction between blade and tang. The object has a black pattination and is covered in patches of orange-red corrosion. The tip of the blade has been bent more than 90 degrees and is slightly broken.Rectangular whittle tang blades are most abundant during the 14th century (Schuster et al., 2012, 146), though examples have been found as early as the 12th century (Holdsworth,1987 ,131). They also continue into the Post Medieval period, but shorter tangs are indicative of an earlier date (Cowgill et al. 1987, 25).

The tag is undecorated but has a mid-brown pattination.There are several examples of lace tags in Margeson (1993, 24, nos. 117-119) which date AD 1720-1942, however they are believed to be mainly 16th-17th century in date (ibid, 1993, 22).

The flute is carved of a tibia, probably from a sheep or goat. The bone is cylindrical, flaring at one end to form a trefoil. The calcareous material in the centre of the bone has been removed. At the flared end, the cork fipple is still in situ creating the blow-hole. Fipples are used to regulate the breath passing through the instrument and are rarely found in place (MacGregor, 1985, 150). There is a square perforation on the shin side of the bone to form a finger-hole.Similar examples can be found in MacGregor (1985, 149) and are predominantly medieval in date. A further example of an ovi-caprid tibia flute found in Egan (1998, 288, Fig 219) is of 11th century date. Also, a similar example in the Museum of London teaching collections is of medieval date (A22674).Hazel Forsyth: \"It is clear that the bone has some kind of block at the proximal end which seems to be made of cork ( at least it has the characteristics of cork and it is difficult to think what else it could be). For it to work as a pipe or perhaps, more correctly a whistle, the block (or fipple) has to have a breathing slot. We (the conservators and Hazel) have looked at the block under the microscope and there is the merest suggestion of a slot, though whether this is a deliberate cut or the product of decay or accident is unclear. The incision is not only indistinct but also seems to be partly formed; there is no way of knowing whether it penetrates all the way through the block to the window. There are no thumb or tone holes and so perhaps, the 'flute' should be categorized as a whistle (if indeed there is a slot in the fipple). If the stopped end is a fipple it would be possible to achieve a double octave from this pipe with constant breath, over-breathing and under-breathing - and I imagine it would be possible to alter the timbre with finger pressure across the open end. It could conceivably have been used in the manner of a tabor pipe or drone.Helen Leaf has made a particular study of these objects (see Galpin Soc. Journal) and notes that the 'earliest of these ?utes dates from the ?fth century and the latest is post-medieval. There is a peak of occurrence in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They have been found in a wide range of site types; from elite sites such as castles, manor houses and monastic sites, but also from rural sites such as small villages and settlements.' I suspect they are still in use in the Urals, Carpathians and other remote places; so dating is problematic.The use of cork for a block is perhaps significant (all of the recorded examples from Continental Europe have fipples of bees wax, wood and, more rarely clay. The medieval port books mention imports of cork but the presence of cork in this piece may suggest an Iberian or Mediterranean attribution - and its presence in London - perhaps a sailor's pipe lost overboard?The pipe is certainly intriguing but for the reasons given above, I cannot be completely sure of its function. It could be a partially worked item.\"Dimensions: length: 153.65 mm; internal diameter at open end: 8.59 mm; blow-hole width: 25.39 mm; weight: 41.19g.Reference: MacGregor, A. 1985.

This button is decoratively made to resemble a Tudor rose. The rose is constructed from five different elements forming four concentric roses that decrease in size that are stacked on top of each other with a central rounded knop. Each of the roses has five heart-shaped petals and the largest, outer rose has five pointed calyxs, one in between each of the petals. On the edges of all the petals and the calyxs there is a piece of filigree resembling twisted rope forming a border. There is no other decoration except on the calyxs which also have a piece of filigree forming a small scroll in the centre. There is a little damage in the form of small holes on three of the petals of the second largest rose. The shape of some of the petals of the largest rose is slightly distorted. On the reverse of the button there is a circular shank for attachment. The shank is constructed from a piece of wire and soldered into place. This has been bent out of alignment so that it now lies flat against the back of the button.The filigree decoration is similar to that on the ball-headed pins and the trefoil-shaped hooked tags of the 16th century (Read 2005:122). Hazel Forsyth (pers comm) agrees with a 16th century date and suggests this button may have been used to ornament a hat or sleeves.As the button is greater than 300 years old and is more than 10% gold it fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act 1996.Dimensions: thickness: 7.44mm; diameter: 18.67mm; weight: 2.03g.Reference: Read, B. 2005.

MacGregor notes that the only known Ivory knife in Britain comes from a 5th-6th century context (1985, 183). Trefoil terminals, as seen on this example, can be found on Early-Medieval to Modern knives. Similarly, ring and dot motifs are ubiquitous throughout history. However, examples of Victorian page turners seem to show spatulate style ivory objects being used for a different function.

This spur has gently curving sides, to fit under the ankle, that have figure-8 terminals.  One of the upper loops is broken and is now incomplete.  On the opposite side an incomplete buckle is still attached to the lower loop.  This buckle is attached via a hooked fitting that passes through the lower loop of the spur terminal and wraps around the cross bar of the buckle with a slot for the pin.  The buckle is incomplete with only one side of the double-sided trapezoidal frame still intact.  This buckle frame has incurved sides and three decorative rectangular projections from the outer edge with triangular smaller projections in between.  The pin is still present wrapped around the crossbar.  The pin has a decorative collar just below the attachment loop.  This spur has a decorative neck that has been cast to form a three-dimensional acorn with annulet stamps to form the pattern of the acorn cup.  The neck is angled upwards, away from the body of the spur and the rowel box projects downwards from the acorn-shaped neck.  The rowel box is also decoratively case with ridges and grooves.  The iron rowel is still present connected to the box with an iron pin.  It was originally a five pointed rowel but two of the points are incomplete.  Traces of tinning survive on the surface of the iron. Ellis(2002:1) notes that spurs made from iron were often tinned to protect them from rust and enhance their appearance.The form of the spur and the buckle suggest a 17th century date.

It consists of three parts: a rectangular tang, a hollow ground lozenge-shaped blade and a needle point. The point was made by twisting the end of the blade. The shape resembles three possible medieval daggers. The rondel dagger was popular from the 14th century onwards and is identifiable by the rounded pommel and handguard (Weland, 2001, 90), which are no longer present. The stiletto was a later form of the rondel dagger, identifiable by a triangular cross section (Ibid, 2001, 92). This blade matches the stiletto, however stilettos tended to have an integrally cast handgrip, which this example does not have. A further parallel can be found in the Misericorde, a common choice of dagger in the 14th century (Lacombe, 1870, 311). This is another derivative of the rondel, made thin enough to fit through the gaps in armour. Without the other features of the weapon present, as well as the amount of corrosion material covering the object, it is difficult to accurately identify it.Blades from Spain and Germany have been known to change in section along the blade but not in this style.

The punches then continue approximately two thirds of the way down the walls with an incised line forming a border below.

The punches are very worn, almost completely worn away in some areas, on the top of the thimble more punches have been created.  These punches are larger and cruder than the original punches.  The punches appear to have been created in rows of 4, set at angles to each other creating an irregular sub-circular pattern.

This is a flat curry comb with 7 wrought bars and 2 knockers, the handle is broken and missing. This curry comb comprises a flat rectangular back plate, the longer edges are folded over and the a row of triangular teeth have been cut into the edge. There are five further toothed bars that have been riveted onto the back plate. The ends of the central toothed bar project around to the back surface of the back plate and terminate in solid knops that form the knockers. Only one is surviving. The handle was also riveted to the back plate, on the opposite side to the teeth. The handle had an elaborate terminal that is still attached to the back plate. This terminal forms a cross-shape with three flaring arms and one smaller, triangular shaped arm with decorative triangular cutouts. The upper arm that would have formed the base of the handle has a central raised rib. There are three surviving rivets which have domed heads; two in the upper arm and one central to the cross. There are semi-circular cutouts in the three other arms which originally may have housed rivets. Small areas of the back plate are missing and one of the shorter edges has been damaged and now curls back on itself.A similar example is illustrated in Clark (1995:161 fig. 119) as part of a 1929 catalogue of stable equipment. Clark writes \"a comb of this flat type is reported from a post medieval (17th or early 18th century) context at Ardingly (W. Sussex), comparte two examples from Jamestown, Virginia.\" John Clark has studied this example and he is happy with a date of 17th - early 18th century although he notes that the type continues into the early 20th century.

This whistle has been constructed from three pieces of sheet silver. The first piece has been rolled to form a tapering cylinder and shaped to form a D-shaped mouthpiece. The second piece is circular and forms a domed end cap to close the open end opposite the mouthpiece. The third piece sits internally running from the mouthpiece to the front edge of the D-shaped sound hole that has been cut away in the upper surface of the whistle. Directly underneath the sound hole on the lower surface of the whistle there is a circular loop soldered on through which articulates a ring made from silver wire. There is a maker's mark stamped into the silver on the upper surface of the whistle adjacent to the mouthpiece. The maker's mark comprises the initials IH. There are two further initials carved into the lower, angled section of the mouthpiece. These initials are EC and may be the owner's initials. There are some dents that slightly distort the overall shape of the whistle.Dimensions:Length: 36.77mm; width of mouthpiece: 7.03mm; diameter at the endcap: 8.98mm; diameter of suspension ring: 11.22mm; weight: 3.04g.Discussion:This whistle can be compared with a fragmentary whistle, also with a maker's mark, reported through the Treasure Act from Lincolnshire, (TAR 2004, no. 346; 2004T253; NLM-7881F0) and a more complete whistle, also marked, from West Sussex, (TAR 1998-9, no. 242).

From the photos, it looks like there are fine inclusions in the clay and, possibly, traces of a red slip coating on the surface.  If this is the case, then it may well be from Italy - these are not very common in this country, and usually of poorer quality than this when they do occur.  The form, however, looks quite well developed and is more akin to those produced in northern France. I would, however, expect French products to be made of a typical pure white clay.  Also, the northern French products usually have a pattern number and/or manufacturers mark on the socket, rather than just floral decoration.  So, its origin is a little uncertain, but I would certainly favour southern Europe if it can be shown that there are fine sandy grains in the fabric and traces of a slip coat.  It looks like it would have been quite a well made pipe originally and something that was a bit different and 'exotic' in its day.In summary, this is an interesting imported piece and one that does not fit into the normal pattern of imports found in this country.  Datewise, these socketed bowls were being introduced in France in the early nineteenth century and appear here from around the 1830s or 1840s onwards.

There is a strip of overlapping metal at the upper end of the slot just below the rim of the bowl. Inside the bowl are the remains of some river mud and small pieces of coal.

Neither have anything similar and cannot suggest a function.David Higgins writes: \"It's particularly odd having what appears to be a mounting slot in the front since, if anything, you would have expected any sort of a 'display' item to be mounted from the stem end, with the bowl sticking out, especially as its a three dimensional form. That is to say, if mounted, then the bowl end ought to be 'sticking out' into fresh air, like part of a statue, when thestem end would be the obvious mounting point. Similarly, if it were part of a decorative design mounted on a surface, such as a scene from the end of a ship, then ought to have been cut in half so it could be mounted flat.\"David later adds: \"I have had a reply back from a colleague in the Netherlands (Felix van Tienhoven, a member of the Acad���mie Internationale de la Pipe and specialises in the study of metal pipes) who independently suggested the 'display sign' option for the pipe, with the slot being for a wooden mounting. My only concern on this front is that there does not appear to be a pin hole for a nail/bolt to hold it in place if this were the case. As I noted to Jacqui, the fact that the spur appears to have been bent slightly suggests that this is wrought rather than cast iron.\""},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.016,51.485],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":0.05,"units":"degrees"}}},"uuid":"4f43227c-72cf-4b11-8046-a04405f69971"},{"type":"Feature","@id":"https://w3id.org/locolligo/English-Visitor-Sites/f1c13f85-4f2a-4f4e-aae9-66ab6f85ca35","properties":{"title":"CLOTH SEAL","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme","url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/538946","description":"An incomplete Post Medieval lead alloy cloth seal, known as an alnage seal, probably dating to the early 17th century.

This is a circular seal box. The base has four circular holes in the bottom ; one central and three arranged around the edge. The three holes around the edge are filled with iron corrosion. There is a hinge cast integrally with both the base and the lid; on the base there are two perforated lugs and on the lid there is one perforated lug which fits between the two lower lugs and an iron pin passes through all three to hinge them. There are traces of iron corrosion surviving in the perforations. There are two notches in opposing sides of the base. The front surface of the lid has a moulded ridge around the edge and in the centre there is a high relief bird showing its chest, wings slightly unfolded, and its head turned right. The bird has been cast separately with a stud on the reverse which passes through the top of the lid. The reverse of the lid show where the stud has been flattened so it is nearly flush with the lid.Similar examples are recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database e.g. WMID550 - only other complete example of a circular seal box with an eagle. HAMP-156A74,BUC-9FE4D2, GLO-D15AD4 and GLO-B305D6 are just the lid with the applied eagle. These other examples show that this design was a relatively popular one, rendered with varying levels of proficiency, perhaps with different consumers in mind. However, the construction of this seal box lid, with a separately rivetted (zoomorphic) motif, is relatively uncommon for the object type. A similar artefact was excavated at Frocester, however, this example had a stylised leopard riveted onto the lid instead of a bird, this dated to the 3rd century (Price, 2000, 55, 56). A second parallel was excavated in London and currently resides in Colchester Museum, this example was dated to the 2nd century (Price, 2000, 55). Andrews (2012:17) writes \"Circular zoomorphic seal-boxes (C2D6) are also generally considered to date from the Neronian & Flavian period running in to the early 2nd century.\"Dimensions: length: 25.43mm; thickness: 10.03mm; diameter: 20.23mm; weight:6.95 g.Colin Andrews (2012) has recently established that seal boxes were used for sealing bundles and bags rather than documents, probably for bags of money though perhaps other precious objects. Andrews (2012:108) writes \"This research project would suggest therefore that seal-boxes seem to have been designed to facilitate the sealing of cloth or leather bags rather than wooden stylus tablets and that this was their primary function We should no longer think of them as 'objects associated with written communication' but rather as objects primarily associated with trade and the economy.\" He continues (2012:109) \"However the evidence presented here would seem to suggest that seal-boxes were primarily used as 'tamper-evident' devices which were attached to bags and pouches most commonly containing cash or small valuables. They would be particularly useful when one needed to send cash from one place to another as described in the famous 'Octavius' letter found at Vindolanda (Tab Vindol II, 343). This association between seal-boxes, cash, and trade, might explain why they seem to have fallen out of use in the second half of the 3rd century A.D. It could be argued that the economic and political crises of those years inhibited the movement of cash and valuables thus making seal-boxes redundant.\"Reference: E Price, 200, Frocester: A Romano-British Settlement its Antecedents and Successors; Volume 2, The Finds, Gloucester and District Archaeological Research Group.Andrews C. 2012.

The mount has been cast in the style of a heraldic crest with a standing boar facing right stood on a twisted rope. The boar has a crown around its neck as a collar and a chain running down the back. There is also a crescent on the shoulder. There is some wear to the body of the boar but there are traces on the legs and underside of the boar of cast marks to represent bristles/fur. One ear is broken and missing. In heraldic terms the crescent is a form of cadency used to indicate this badge was used by the second son. On the reverse there are three rivets for attachment. Each of these rivets appears to have an integral rectangular plate which has been soldered onto the body of the mount. The surface of the reverse is irregular with pitting and seemingly marks of where the molten metal was poured into the mould and set.The Museum of London has lead alloy boar badges in the collections. These have an integral pin for attachment. Spencer (1998:288-9) illustrates one example no. 281h a badge of a boar, bristled and membered. This example is similar to the above but it is not stood on a length of twisted rope nor does it have the collar of a crown. Spencer (ibid.) writes \"Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III) took the white boar as his cognizance. Differenced only by a change of colour, this badge probably derived from Edward III...In 1483, royal wardrobe accounts show that thousands of boar badges were hastily ordered for use at Richard III's coronation in July, and again for the investiture of his young son, Edward, as Prince of Wales in September.\"This mount is in the style of livery badges which would be worn by retainers and household servants to show their allegiance (Spencer 1998:278). Spencer continued \"the badges identified their wearers as persons who were formally attached, or in some way beholden, to a particular magnet (or to the King himself) and who in return enjoyed their lord's protection or patronage\". However the device was often chosen by the wearer and the same device could be simultaneously be used by different families so it can be hard to accurately identify the family or individual. Spencer (1998:279) notes that retainer's badges with devices were in fashion by the mid-14th century and continued in some households into the 17th century but they were at their peak in the second half of the 15th century during the dynastic struggles of the Houses of York and Lancaster.Smith (1990) mentions the tomb of Ralph Fitzherbert in Norbury, Derbyshire (d. 1483) where there is a stone effigy wearing a livery collar comprising two straps (one over each shoulder) which meet in the centre of the chest. At the junction of the two straps, just above a buckle there is a boar badge pendant, also collared and chained. Along the straps are alternate rose and sun mounts (rose en soleil) indicating Yorkist allegiance and the boar is the white boar livery badge of Richard III. Smith (1990) explains the livery collage consisted of a strip of leather, silk or velvet set with mounts in gold, silver or latten, ending in two buckles linked by an ornamental trefoil from a badge could be suspended.Similar boar mounts/badges are also recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database for example, SWYOR-1781B2 and LEIC-F17145 - both appear to have the remains of pins or rivets on the reverse for attachment and are also copper alloy examples, however they do not have the crown collar.  YORYM-1716A4 and LEIC-A6C834 are silver gilt examples and the recorders note that the symbol of the white boar was used by Richard III's household and followers between the 1470's and 1485.  LEIC-A6C834was found during the 2009 survey of the Battle of Bosworth (AD1485).  A similar badge was also found at Middleham Castle, North Yorkshire and is now housed at the Yorkshire Museum.

The sides have bands of decoration which starts with a band of repeated triangular motifs; then a wide band of star-shaped indentations; at the bottom of this band before the next band of decoration there are two maker's marks, both the same, comprising an isoceles triangle with three pellets arranged around the peak; they resemble small trees.  The next band of decoration comprises alternate annulets and triangles with lines separating them.  Underneath this is a hunting scene showing running deers amongst trees being chased by dogs.  There is a pelleted border above and below the hunting scene and then finally the band with annulets and triangles is repeated.A silver thimble with a similar hunting scene is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art accession no 10.135.3 it is dated 1577 and is probably from Nuremberg, Germany.  The style of the two thimbles is very similar although the precise detail of the decoration is different.  Holmes (1988: 3) writes that thimbles with  hand-punched indentations often have a maker's mark which is struck  where the spiral of indentations begins near the base.  These would  appear to have been imported mostly from Nuremberg, under the ordinances  of the Guild of Thimble makers, all thimbles and sewing rings were  required to carry the mark of the master who made them.

There is a scalloped edge along the bottom of the mast and the rigging presumably marking the edge of the deck.A toy ship with similar masts and rigging is illustrated in Forsyth & Egan (2005:323) no. 10.17, however the body of the ship is solid and the stand is a different shape.

A curved plate, resembling part of a shoe-horn, went down inside the shoebetween the shoe and the man's heel, while a bar, bent over the upper edge of the shoe, came down outside the leather, and in this specimen had a screw-hole at the bottom of the bar for a screw to tighten it to the leather. From the upper part of this bar projects a short curved neck, carrying a five-pointed rowel, about an inch in diameter.

This toy copies the shape of a functional frying pan being circular with an extended handle so it could be safely held over an open fire (Egan & Forsyth 2005:117).  There is a looped terminal at the top of the handle, it is decorated with a twisted rope motif and there is an acorn-shaped terminal projecting from the top.  The loop is again imitating the full-sized version which typically hung from a hook when not in use.    The handle is decorated with a moulded pattern comprising alternate ring and dots with diagonal lines, perhaps representing a twisted rope motif.  There are two circular knops at the junction between the handle and the brackets, again decorated with ring and dot motifs.  The frying pan has two brackets which attach the handle to the pan.  There is a fleur-de-lys terminal projecting from the base of the handle between the two brackets.  This terminal is bent over and now lies flat against the back of the handle.  The brackets are decorated with a twisted rope motif extending along the length of the brackets.  When the frying pan was discovered the handle was bent back against the pan.  The finder straightened it shortly after discovery.  One of the brackets is no longer attached to the handle.The circular pan is slightly distorted by damage.  The centre of the pan is decorated with a double rose of five petals and the points of the calyx extend beyond and between the petals.  The inner petals of the double rose are rounded while the outer petals are wider and have indented centres, created two lobes on the outer edge of each petal.  There is a ring and dot motif between each calyx, located just above each indent in the centre of the petals' outer edge.  A wide band of foliate design surrounds the central motif.  A maker's mark is contained within this foliate band; it is directly aligned with the plane of the handle.  The mark shows the letters ID over Q within a plain oval cartouche.  There is a pellet above the ID and one to the right of the Q and one to the left of the Q.  There is an annulet between the I and the D.  Some of the toys with a similar mark within the Museum of London's collections also have date stamps which cover 1640 - 1646 (Egan & Forsyth 2005:47).   The rose and foliate border are both contained within double concentric circles.  The upper part of the bowl is plain.  The rim is decorated with a twisted rope motif.  This motif extends around the majority of the rim but it is missing for a small section between the two brackets of the handle.  The rim in this section is plain and undecorated.Egan & Forsyth (2005:303 no. 8.144) illustrate a very similar object described as a single pierced ear porringer.  On this published example the ear is missing leaving two stubs remaining decorated with a twisted rope pattern.  The bowl of the porringer is decorated with am almost identical pattern to this frying pan.  There is a slight variation in the maker's mark in that it doesn't appear to have the annulet between the I and the D; it seems to have a pellet instead.Reference: Forsyth, H. and Egan, G. 2005.

The tip of component has broken off at the fourth barb; therefore the full length and number of barbs is uncertain.The component was connected to a pole and there are a variety of attachment notches to enable this. Along the same edge as the barbs is a triangular notch (31.9mm long and 2.7mm deep), with one long gradual side and the other at a sharp 90 degree angle to the side of the dart itself. In this notch would have sat a companion protrusion on the pole. On the opposite edge of the component is a smaller square notch (9.3mm long and 5.2mm deep), followed by a narrowing of the width of the tip (smallest point 8.4mm wide), until the terminal which has an abrupt widening (maximum 11.5mm wide). This shaping would have held binding rope or material that held the pole and tip together, and the wider terminal ensured that the binding did not slip off.

These elements are grouped together by bracket, consisting of a silver strip of three conjoined circles bent into a U, with the two ends (once) joined by a silver rivet above the figure's head; one end of the bracket is now detached, though the rivet is still in place. Looking at the object so the detached side of the bracket its showing, the individual elements can be described as follows:The upper-third of first element takes the form of a naked female bust, with her head in quarter-profile (left), though much of her facial features are worn away. At her shoulders and hips there are pairs of rounded projections; these might suggest limbs, but are probably just decorative. Midline on her waist is a raised roundel. The middle third of the first element is broadly flat in plan, with three raised linear mouldings (a larger one between two evenly sized smaller ones) below. The lower third of the first element is flared, widening top to bottom, with the end bent over at right angles, inwards, to form both an implement, and a possible clasp to the set. The back of the first element is flat and undecorated. The second element is broken, at the point parallel to neck height on the first element. Both faces of this element are flat and undecorated. The third element is a silhouette of the first. Its lower third is however in the form of a lozenge, and was presumably used as a tooth/nail pick. Both faces of this element are flat and undecorated. The fourth element is of the same form as the first element, but reversed (so that the bust on both sides faces outwards). The upper and middle parts of this element are broadly the same as those on the first, but there is no surviving roundel at the figure's waist. The lower third of this element is broadly flat in plan with a small bowl at its end, to form an ear-scoop. The reverse (inside side) of this element is flat and largely undecorated, apart from the inscribed letters SD (presumably the owner's or maker's mark), between the neck and the waist of the bust. The bracket (described above) is decorated with incised lines in the form of chevrons. From the bracket are two silver rings, forming part of an attachment chain.Discussion: Another, similar 17th Century cosmetic set was found in Gloucestershire, GLO-5FB557.  The individual elements are also similar to other silver cosmetic implements recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database of the 17th century; see NCL-B5BCC7 for example.Dimensions: Total length 81.5mmLength of attachments 57.7mmDiameter of ring 11.5mmWidth of attachments 8.4mmThickness of attachments 7.2mmLength of bracket 10.3mmWidth of bracket 6.0mmThickness of bracket 5.5mmWeight 10.58g"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.072,51.501],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":0.05,"units":"degrees"}}},"uuid":"f538aa49-886a-4c7d-b81d-27390b1b8f9d"},{"type":"Feature","@id":"https://w3id.org/locolligo/English-Visitor-Sites/e478dbb3-30c3-45da-9bb8-00ae380d13dc","properties":{"title":"COIN","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme","url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/461084","description":"A very worn and corroded copper alloy as of Nero dating to the period AD 64 to 67.

This excavated example has a similar construction and decoration but does not appear to have the V-shaped variation around the pin rest and it is also made from horn rather than bone. It is dated to the 12th century. A further similar buckle, also made from bone, has also been excavated from a deserted medieval village at Goltho, Lincolnshire (MacGregor (1985:104-5).

Both of the tails touch the edges of the pan and extend up the sides. The fish are surrounded by an evenly spaced, fine stippling, suggestive of hot bubbling fat or perhaps herbs and berries.This frying pan is similar to no. 2.18 illustrated by Egan & Forsyth (2005:120) to which the authors have suggested a date of 17th century.

The sherd has been made in the fine, bright orange-red fabric associated with Samian-ware, and is very hard. It has been tempered with an extremely fine quartz and has few inclusions. The vessel has been covered with an orange-red slip. On the reverse of the sherd, the lower half of one small element of moulded decoration is visible in the uppermost field.

The small key has an oval-bow with a kidney-shaped aperture defined by an inwardly projecting point from the centre where the bow abuts the stem. The hollow stem has been roughly faceted at this proximal end so that it is hexagonal in section; towards the bit of the key, however, the stem expands slightly and progresses to more of a circular section. The key bit projects outwards some 13.74mm, at ninety-degrees to the stem, and is flush with the distal end of it. There is no channel between the bit and the stem, the large sub-cruciform cleft in the upper half of the bit reaches right up to the stem. Below this is a further simple cleft at the lowest edge of the bit, reaching inwards around half the width of the bit. The key is in good condition, and has sustained damage at only three points. One of these is a small area lost out of the bow, the others are from the uppermost edge of the stem.

The fragment consists of a bone scale with a D-shaped section that would have comprised one hemispherical half of an oval-sectioned knife handle. It is difficult to estimate how long the handle would have been as one end of the fragment is broken. The other end appears to have been the finished terminal of the handle as it has been shaped into a flat outer edge, with a gentle curve into the upper face of the handle. The handle has been decorated with an incised geometrical pattern that divides into three panels running along the length of the handle. This would have been a way of easily dealing with the potential difficulties of decorating the curved handle. The central of the three long panels has been filled with pairs of striations at ninety degrees to the length of the handle. On either side of this panel is a thick incised border, below which on each side the field has been filled with a cross-hatched design. MacGregor (1985, 170) notes that such cross-hatching design is commonly encountered in knife handles from the Post Medieval period, as it serves both a decorative purpose and a functional one, as it improves the grip of the handle. On the reverse of the fragment, the flat face of the bone has not been decorated. At the outer edge opposite the terminal, the fragment steps down sharply just before the break, and this may indicate where the material had been shaped to accommodate the tang of the knife-blade. The fragment is in good condition and is a buff-biscuit colour.Dimensions: length: 39.64mm; width: 18.53mm; thickness: 8.35mm; weight: 6.71g.Reference: MacGregor, A. 1985.

From the upper and lower outer corners of each loop projects a rounded knop. Here, the buckle was poorly finished after casting, and small projecting tabs of metal that spilled over during the casting process have not been filed off. The loops narrow slightly as they curve inwards towards the strap bar, which is on the same plain as the loops and undecorated at the upper and lower edges of the frame with a small pointed knop. A pin would have been wound around this bar in order to fasten the buckle, but this is now missing. The reverse of the buckle frame is undecorated and fairly corroded. The buckle frame has a golden yellow patina, but is fairly covered with a black coating, which is a decayed organic substance likely to be Linseed oil. The Linseed oil survives in thick patches also on the reverse of the frame. Egan (2005) illustrates a number of similar buckles, pp.34-35, most notably ref. 77 which has black coating.Notes: Egan (2005, 16) dates the fashion for coating metal objects with linseed oil to the late 15th century, and suggests it remained popular until around 1550.

At that time, glass beads were a major part of the currency exchanged for people and products. The beads proved to be a cheap and efficient means of exploiting African resources, especially as glassmaking technologies developed in Europe.

The tile has been made using an iron-rich clay heavily tempered with grog and quartz; the fabric has not been mixed evenly and these tempers gather in large striations. The fabric also contains a large number of air bubbles. The front surface of the brick has been decorated with a swirling pattern that was incised by the maker with a fingernail whilst the clay was still plastic. Such marks made pre-firing are usually known as signature marks, but they tend to be a small hemisphere or symbol, and restricted to one area of the brick. This decoration seems to cover the entire surface of the brick, and therefore is more likely to be a kind of graffiti than a signature mark. On the reverse of the brick, along with the two edges of the find where the sides of the object remain intact, a large amount of Roman mortar remains in situ.

The width of the scabbard chape indicates it would have served for a dagger rather than a sword. The chape has been made out of folded sheet with a soldered seam. It is 26.7mm wide at the top opening, and tapers downwards from here until it forms a point. A collared knop cast in a different copper alloy has been soldered onto the lowest point of the chape; it is 7.7mm in diameter. Towards this point on one side of the chape, the letters XI (if the chape points from left to right) have been incised near the upper edge. The chape?s copper alloy sheet is quite worn and thin, and has given way in places. At the opening of the chape the sheet is intact as it is supported by a layer of organic material preserved inside. This is probably the remnants of the leather scabbard. Here the artefact is approximately 7.6mm thick. Tests for iron on this area proved negative, and so no part of the dagger blade remains. The surface of the chape has a red-brown patina. The scabbard chape is a hybrid of the styles represented in Egan (2005), as it has been formed out of sheet but has had a cast element added with solder. Generally, however, Egan notes (2005, 192) that chapes were fashionable during the 16th century but had diminished in appeal by around 1600. \tDimensions: length: 79.5mm; width: 26.7mm; thickness: 7.6mm; weight: 11.58g.Reference: Egan, G. 2005.

This tankard is of stave construction and the handle has been carved integrally with one of the staves. The upper edges of the staves have been cut at an angle to create a narrow edge to the rim; it is the inner surface that is angled. The handle has a rectangular cross-section and the top and outer edges are shaped with notches to create a decorative profile. The staves are held together with two iron bands which are riveted closed. One of the iron bands is broken across a perforation which suggests the iron band may have possibly been reused. On the base the letters \"RH\" have been carved. There are no other markings on the body or base of the tankard. There are two peg holes in the handle for the articulation of the lid. The lid is no longer present. The fill was excavated in the Museum of London conservation lab and there was nothing significant contained within. Rebecca Lang. Conservator, suggests the staves appear to be oak and the handle beech.Similar examples have been found on the wreck of the Mary Rose and Marc Meltonville also believes this example is most likely connected to ships. Marc also notes that coopers do not carve an integral handle this is a different technique to one that coopers would use. The tankards found on the Mary Rose are of a similar stave construction but they have willow hoop fragments rather than the iron on the above example. In total 27 wooden drinking tankards were found distributed throughout the wreck suggesting they were in use throughout the ship. The authors (2005:450-2) note that most of the tankards are made up of elements of different woods, though pine is the most popular for the staves. Most have markings and many of these are based on the broad arrow and cross, perhaps indicating official provisions. These tankards had lids and evidence of pitch lining.Hazel Forsyth notes a capacity of 3 pints suggests that it was used as a decanter rather than a measure. The lid is missing but objects of this type and date are exceptionally rare and this vessel is in a very good state of preservation. So far as I know it is the only one of its kind from London soil. Shakespeare doesn't refer to 'tankards' in his plays but the word 'pot' crops up from time to time - so perhaps there is a link there.Dimensions: height: 220mm; diameter at base: 162mm; diameter at top: 112.48mm; weight: 1806.2g (with some mud still attached the wood waterlogged); capacity: 1850ml to top (3.25 pints)Reference: Gardiner, J. and Allen, M.

The one-piece comb has been formed from a single piece of ivory, possibly cetacean bone given that the comb was crafted in one piece and that the teeth had to be aligned with the grain (MacGregor 1985). The comb is double-sided, with the scars for a set of coarse teeth on one side of a central reserve and a set of fine teeth on the other, a few of which are now missing. The elliptical section of the comb means that although the teeth are slender in profile, from front to back they are considerably wider. The central reserve has a crude incised decoration on front and back, with a circle containing a geometric, six-petalled flower at the axis between the central reserve and end, and an empty oval at the middle of the central reserve. The boundaries of the central reserve are not symmetrical; the fine teeth meet the reserve in a straight line, but where the coarse teeth have been carved out, the boundary of the central reserve slopes, so that the reserve tapers toward the end section that is now lost. The remaining end section of the comb is narrow, undecorated and tapers toward the side with the coarse teeth. One laminated sheet of the ivory has been lost at this corner.

The handle then widens sharply out into what would have been a polygonal reserve with three decorative incised lines and a number of fine teeth. Sections are missing on both sides of the remaining reserve so we cannot tell how large this would have been. The size would have been constrained, however, by the choice of material, as the teeth of the comb would have had to follow the grain of the ivory; Hazel Forsyth suggested in this case the material is elephant ivory. The artefact was probably a functional comb or tool rather than being used in the hair, as it seems the fine teeth would have extended considerably from the rather short handle. The handle itself is more suggestive of the rounded handles of toilet implements, or various pegs, but the teeth make these interpretations unlikely.

There are two rectangular slot tabs near the top and the remains of two near the bottom, one or two other leaves to this shrine probably articulated at these tabs.  The outer surface of the sides is covered with moulded cross-hatching.  The back surface is decorated with finer cross-hatching and a large cross which may be the cross of St George or simply the standard Christian symbol.

The antler has been carved to form an irregular circular  disc; the back side is flat, the front is convex.  The front is carved with the linear bust of a  bearded figure facing left and wearing a domed headpiece.  There are three curving lines radiating from the back of the headgear, presumably ribbons or ties, and a carved line forms a border around the edge of the counter.A similar gaming piece found in Southwark is illustrated in MacGregor (1985:130 fig.71).  The Southwark example is carved on both sides with a pattern.Geoff Egan suggests the date of 12th century and that it may have sub-Russian origins; the figure is difficult to interpret, although, with broad dating to the period of the Crusades, it looks more like some kind of Eastern official or military personage than a mitred, high-ranking member of the English Church.Dimensions: diameter: 36.94mm; thickness: 7.49mm; weight: 10.99g.Identification by Geoff Egan, PAS Finds Advisor Medieval and Post Medieval Artefacts.Reference: MacGregor, A. 1985.

Both are in a reasonable state of preservation although the dagger's organic hilt-plates and pommel, and the sheath's suspension loop(s) and chape, are missing. Initial cleaning of the surface corrosion products on the sheath in the laboratory by Rebecca Lang has revealed negative traces clearly demonstrating the former existence of a series of overlapping ? copper alloy strips decorated with bands of repouss��� dots. (It is possible that these strips copied leather originals.) X-rays have also revealed the positions of a number of pins arranged in a broadly linear fashion down the back of the sheath, by which means the now-missing decorative strips were presumably secured. A further series of three narrow ? iron bands clasp (rather than encircle) the sheath, and these may have been the means by which the missing suspension loop(s) were attached. The sheath itself appears to have been constructed of two separate slender plano-convex 'leaves' of ash wood, effectively bound together by the (missing) overlapping ? copper alloy strips. It is hoped that further conservation work will be able to confirm both this and other constructional details. The Chambers Wharf dagger can be added to a small group of late Hallstatt examples, all but one of which were probably recovered from the west London Thames (Jope 1961; Macdonald 1978). The single outlier, from Luttre in Belgium, may be a British export.
