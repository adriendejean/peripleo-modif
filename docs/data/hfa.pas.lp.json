Symbol marks on their own were used by a number of London makers.  However, this pipe is unusual because it has an initial over the symbol mark. The combination of a symbol and initials would suggest that this pipe dates to the first half of the 18th century. The maker may possibly be Humphrey Parbatt who received his freedom in 1729 at St George in the East (Oswald 1975: 142), which would narrow the date to c.AD1720-1750.The parallel marks on the heel are also interesting, When a heel is trimmed it normally has marks running from front to back, and not sideways like on this example.

It should be remembered that for much of the 18th Century, the Society held the contract to supply medicinals to the Army and to the Admiralty and this would have included scales, weights, bandages and all the other necessary items as well as medications.The earliest of this type had rather archaic depictions of the Apothecary Symbols and were often stamped with a rose-like sign. Professor Biggs states that &#39;this markmay have some connection with the Apothecaries Company&#39;.It is also interesting to note that these weights did not really seem to replace anything very specific but suddenly appeared and their use seems to have become quite widespread very quickly.It also seems that these weights, though the symbols became a little more standardised, were almost the only ones available for the next 100 or so years until the advent of the commercial Scale Companies in the early 19th Century.&quot;","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.070834,51.501343],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/d72cdfc8-e296-4880-88de-494d91e316b4","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"TOKEN","id":1016895,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/1016895","description":"A complete Post-Medieval copper-alloy farthing trade token,&nbsp;issued by John Condley of Yarmouth, Norfolk.

Toys, Trifles and Trinkets. Base Metal Miniatures from London 1200 to 1800.

The apparent survival of pans as opposed to handles is not surprising since tiny thin strips of lead alloy are unlikely to have been recognised for what they are... Moreover, the pan element is much more likely to have been kept as a serviceable bowl or platter, and at least one was converted to form a whirligig.\"\"Pictorial sources and contemporary recipes suggest that frying pans were used for many kinds of foods and yet the base-metal toy pans only seem to have been cast with fish, reflecting the fact that fresh and dried fish were a staple element of the diet... The mould-makers have clearly made some effort to produce the salient features of a fish, and although some of the anatomical details are highly stylized, most are shown with gills, scales and fins... It is also evident that some attempt has been made to represent different species, and these are partly indicated by shape, size, the presence or absence of barbels and spines and other anatomical details. After the middle of the 18th century, oval pans were generally used for frying fish.\"Reference: Forsyth, H. and Egan, G. 2005. Toys, Trifles and Trinkets.

The maker/makers with the mark IDQ are one of the few who do mark their work. It is unknown who IDQ is/are but the use of a triad of initials rather than the usual single or double letters may suggest a husband and wife or father and son partnership (ibid.). Within the Museum of London's collection of toys the first dated pieces known are those by IDQ which seem to have been produced between 1636 and 1646.The origin of I(D)Q is unknown several toys have been discovered in London but a continental origin has been discussed as examples of I(D)Q's work have been recovered from excavations on the Continent, including Paris and Amsterdam. Egan and Forsyth (2005:441) note that the form, style and decoration of the I(D)Q wares do point to a Low Countries or Continental source. However, more toys made by I(D)Q have been found in London than in Paris or Amsterdam, which may suggest they were made by an immigrant craftsman (ibid: 54).

Toys, Trifles and Trinkets. Base Metal Miniatures from London 1200 to 1800. Unicorn Press, LondonEgan &amp; Forsyth (2005:120-1) write that it is quite common for just the pan without the handle to survive. &quot;Evidently the thin, weak handles were liable to snap off and most have broken at the point of greatest mechanical weakness: at the junction of the pan and the handle. The apparent survival of pans as opposed to handles is not surprising since tiny thin strips of lead alloy are unlikely to have been recognised for what they are... Moreover, the pan element is much more likely to have been kept as a serviceable bowl or platter, and at least one was converted to form a whirligig.&quot;&quot;Pictorial sources and contemporary recipes suggest that frying pans were used for many kinds of foods and yet the base-metal toy pans only seem to have been cast with fish, reflecting the fact that fresh and dried fish were a staple element of the diet... The mould-makers have clearly made some effort to produce the salient features of a fish, and although some of the anatomical details are highly stylized, most are shown with gills, scales and fins... It is also evident that some attempt has been made to represent different species, and these are partly indicated by shape, size, the presence or absence of barbels and spines and other anatomical details. After the middle of the 18th century, oval pans were generally used for frying fish.&quot;Reference: Forsyth, H. and Egan, G. 2005. Toys, Trifles and Trinkets.

The cupel has a hard grainy grey fabric.Measurements: 28.63mm in diameter, 19.38mm high and 22.02g in weightDiscussion: Cupels were an integral part of the cuppellation process, in which impure noble metals (mostly gold and silver) were purified with the help of litharge (White 2010, 1). The impure metal would be heated with the litharge where the impure metals would react with the litharge and separate from the noble metals in the melt leaving a small glob or 'regulus' ofnoble metal int he cuple (ibid).It has been suggested that cupels only usually survive in the archaeological record once they've been used, as thanks to the absorbtion of the litharge allows the simple ash fabric to remain solid (White 2010, 2). This process leaves the cupels a dark grey, similar to this example (ibid). Cupels were particularly common in the assaying of metals during the 16th and early 17th century and associated with the mint based at the Tower of London, with a number of used and unusually unused examples recovered from its' grounds (White 2010). It should also be noted that the heavy presence of the jewellery industry (in which ??cuppellation also played a role) in Cheapside and the popularity of alchemy and during the 16th and 17th century may account for some of the cupels recovered from the Thames.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.059607,51.507173],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/a233936a-85de-458d-b34d-55e0c65dc311","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"TOKEN","id":977748,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/977748","description":"A complete, Post-Medieval, uniface, cast, lead token dating to the 16th to 18th Century.Description: The token is decorated on one face with a long cross and a pellet in each quadrant.

'The decoration on this example can be paralleled on three pipe bowls found in contexts dating to before c.1720 from Warsaw Castle in Poland and likely originating in South-East Europe (Meyza 2005). A number of similar examples although not as closely linked on decoration are knwon from Britain often from places with maritime connections (Higgins 2015, 16-17). A date of late 17th to 18th century is thus suggested.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.012952,51.50394],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/b232124a-a737-4f02-8827-8fa4ed7c8a73","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"MANUFACTURING DEBRIS","id":975321,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/975321","description":"A possible Post Medieval pinner's bone dating to the 16th century.Description: The tool is made from a worked long bone bone that at one end has been roughly trimmed on three sides.

It has a convex cross section The tip features two rivet holes and is slightly bent over towards the back of the plate. The base of the plate features a small aperture with the attachment edge rising either side of it The front plate is undecorated on both the front and back.

Discussion: Strap clasps have been discussed in depth by Egan and Pritchard (2002) and Teresa Gilmore (2019). Their date range is roughly from 1250 to 1450 (Egan and Pritchard 2002, 22, 116; fig. 11).  For two-part clasps Gilmore (2019, 5-6) suggests a date range of c. 1350-1450.  The dating of three-part clasps with transverse ridges along the sides, from London c. 1270-1450, can be compared with tighter dating in the 14th century for buckles with the same side ridges.  Further dating evidence comes from the composite construction of certain examples with a forked spacer (Egan and Pritchard 2002, 119-120; fig. 78); by analogy with buckles made in this way, they date to the late 14th to early 15th centuries.  Some of these composite clasps also feature the transverse side ridges of the 14th-century buckle series, but which are absent on the oval frames of composite buckles.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.018143,51.486716],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/2bb0cc28-1aad-41ca-a5a2-f8f45cd2c78f","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"BOOK FITTING","id":958439,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/958439","description":"An incomplete copper-alloy book clasp of later Medieval to early post-medieval date, c.1450-1700.Description: The clasp is incomplete and is formed of a single sheet of copper alloy.

More crudely made than Type 2 - made from broad but thinner strips of metal that don't show the wavy edge caused by punching the nail-holes to the same exaggerated extent as the later shoes, which were made of narrower but thicker bars which 'spread' more when the holes were punched. Round nail-holes, with broad rectangular/ovoid countersinking to take the nail-heads (compared with the narrower slots of Type 2). Calkins on the heels are rare, and shallow if they exist...The size, width around 100mm, is average for these early shoes - horses were small, of course.It's probably a front shoe - the width and length are about the same, whereas rear shoes are longer than they are wide.

This is a Oswald type 3. The tobacco pipe has a flat teardrop shaped heal. There is no maker's stamp impressed on the base of the heal. The pipe bowl is barrel-shaped, with a milled bowl rim which is inclined at an obtuse angle to the stem. Oswald (1969:7) writes \"Milling on the rim of these early types is rare.\" The stem of the pipe has nine 'snowflake' stamps arranged in a diamond shape, with 1/2/3/2/1 configuration. The stamp is cross shaped design made from four outward facing fleur-de-lis within a diamond. This stamp is similar to that used by Robert Cotton on his Jamestown pipes. The pipe has a bore hole running within the length of the stem.Straube writes: \" Most bear a distinctive cross-shaped design made by impressing a metal stamp with four fleur-de-lis and a diamond.\"?Dimensions: length: 52.06mm; width: 15.36mm; height: 23.22mm; inside diameter of bowl: 9.17mm; outside diameter of bowl: 11.49mm; bore hole diameter: 2.47mm; weight: 6.59g.?Straube writes \"Robert Cotton, \"tobacco-pipe-maker,\" arrived in Jamestown in April 1608 - his inclusion in one of the first groups of craftsmen shows the importance of the tobacco smoking market. The Virginia Company may have sent him to test Virginia clays for pipemaking and pottery production. Good Virginia clay could break the monopoly held by Dorset clay merchants in the London pipemaking industry. No other mention is made of Cotton; he is not listed in the colony census of 1624-25, so he had probably either perished or returned to England by then. \"Higgins? writes \"The tobacco plant is native to the Americas and was unknown outside of the New World before Columbus's voyage of 1492. The introduction of tobacco to Europe and its rapid spread around the world has been covered by various other authors and will not be recited here. Suffice it to say that tobacco was initially passed around the aristocratic gardens of Europe as a medicinal herb but that it was the English who were primarily responsible for adopting the habit of smoking (Oswald 1975, 3-6). The first references to smoking in England appear during the 1560s and 1570s, but it was not until the 1580s that it seems to have been sufficiently common for recognisable pipe forms to emerge - and tobacco remained a relatively rare and expensive luxury until the development of plantations in the American colonies during the early seventeenth century.The earliest pipe makers appear to have worked in the south west, where there would have been easy access to tobacco carried on ships coming from the Americas, and in London itself (Higgins 2009, 41).

Description: A small, circular, ceramic disc formed from the foot-ring of a Roman vessel of a light orange brown, unglazed fabric.  The disc has a smooth, concave surface with worn, rounded breaks at the base of the now lost sides. On the underside surface are incised circular grooves set within a raised outer edge.Measurements: This gaming piece measures 31.77mm diameter, narrowing to 30.84mm at the base. The internal diameter base: 28.15mm. The walls are irregular in height but its maximum thickness is 11.11mm. It weighs 21.63 grams.Discussion: This object is an example of the secondary use of an object which was originally a fineware, roman bowl. The smooth concave surface was the inner surface of the vessel and the surface with circular grooves, the footring found on the underside of the vessel. Crummy (1983:93) suggests that the most likely use of such objects is as gaming counters. Similar examples are also published from Roman Castleford, (Cool & Philo 1998) which share a similar interpretation though this extends them to possibly counting tokens also. In 2019 a similar object was found in situ used as a stopper on a ring necked flagon at the Roman Settlement site at Bridge Farm, East Sussex.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.055073,51.495887],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/7580ca84-7efd-4600-9640-f382314f91fa","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"TOKEN","id":914653,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/914653","description":"A complete Medieval lead alloy token, 17.82mm in diameter, dating to the late 15th century 1400 - 1500AD.

Those carrying initials are generally deemed to be post-Medieval in date (1500-1850) (Fletcher 2005, 50-66), those which seem to mimic Medieval penny designs were previously deemed to be 15th-16th century (Fletcher 2005, 40-45) but a number of examples combined between the mimicing penny designs and initial types make this unlikely and the usual c. 1500-1850 date for a lead token is suggested here.

The remaining part of the dish consists of the flange only, the bowl having been cut out. On the upper surface of the flange are two sets of pewterer's touchmark, comprising one set of four 'hallmarks', in elaborate cartouches' with scroll work tops. These consist: possible a leopards head (which is indistinct indicating that it was slightly misstruck); lion rampant; the initials RT with pellets above and below; a hand. Diametrically opposite is the second set of stamps comprising two stamps one with the letter G and the other with the letter F again in elaborate cartouches. These touchmarks are not listed in Cotterell (1929) nor Jackson (1970).Dimensions: diameter: 130.40mm; weight: 70.28g.Cotterell (1929:51-52) writes \"The last type of mark which the maker impressed as referring to himself, and one of the utmost importance from the connoisseur's point of View, is that of the three, four or more-usually four-devices contained in small shields or cartouches, struck in a row and resembling the Hall-mark of the Goldsmiths.For want of a better designation one must it seems follow the general acceptance of the term and call them \"Hall-Marks,\" though nothing was ever more certain than that they were nothing of tire kind, for neither had they connexion with, nor were they in any way recognised by, the Authorities at Pewterers' Hall. On the contrary, the Company was in constant trouble with the Goldsmiths over them, which in 1635 culminated' in the Court of Aldermen forbidding their use by the Pewterers. This order may have been observed temporarily, but Chap. VI is full of instances of its being flagrantly disobeyed later in the same century.One of the earliest instances of their use is that of Nicholas Kelk (No. 2704, g.'U.), who was a Freeman of the Company as early as 1641 (probably earlier). He would therefore have full knowledge of this ruling of the Court of Aldermen in 1635. The fact however remains that, from c. 1675 onwards, the Pewterers used these \"Hall-marks\" quite freely, without let or hindrance, so long as they were accompanied by their proper touches.On early examples the \"Hall-Mark \" is found on the front of a plate or dish, generally on the rim but occasionally in the well, with the maker's touch on the back, and this method would seem to have obtained until the second quarter of the eighteenth century, but from this period onwards it was the custom to stamp all these marks on the back, in the centre. It is a most unusual thing to find a piece, of later date than about 1735, with the \"Hall-Marks\" on the front.Turning to the speculative side of these \"Hall-Marks.\" So long as the initials in them are the same as in the maker's touch, all is easily understandable, but this does not by any means always happen; eg. John Home, No. 2393, who used a \"Hall-Mark wherein the initials \"S.S\" appear. This \"Hall-Mark\" is known to be that of Samuel Smith, No. 4 3 79. The question we have to answer is - Which of the two made the piece?In the remarks which follow reference must be understood to London pewterers only, for if we turn to country craftsmen, we find \" confusion worse' confounded,\" and m such cases as those of the Duncombs ; Birch 85 Villers ; Yates & Birch ; .Yates, Berh 8: Spooner; James Yates, etc., the intermingling of such marks leaves but little hope of an ultimate unravelling.\"Reference: Hornsby, P., Weinstein, R. and Homer, R. 1989.

Diverging from this standard form one can observe a number of variants. Tokens bearing a single dot in each angle of the cross normally have an anti-clockwise ray border and a cross with straight arms. Tokens made of pewter, a late characteristic, also all have an anti-clockwise ray border. This anti-clockwise form of ray border which is, so far as one can judge, a late evolutionary form also occurs on nearly all tokens which have three pellets in each angle of the cross. One should emphasise that although these observations may help to define evolutionary tendencies, they do not demarcate any exclusive class of token.\"References: Mitchiner, M. and Skinner, A. 1984.

There is a key hole in the centre of the body on one side which takes the form of a vertical stem joined to a circular top. Inside the circular part of the keyhole there is a solid circular tube still in-situ. The padlock is dark brown in colour with patches of redish brown corrosion. The padlock is 54.7 mm in length, 34 mm in width, with a body diameter of 30.1 mm. The body is 28.7mm thick; weight: 36.59g.A similar find on the database is record LON-C8DC0B, which references the following:Two similar examples can be found in Bart et al. (1977, nos. 696-697), made of cast iron and date from the late 15th-17th century. Another example can be found in the Walsall museums' collection (1982.0091), which is Medieval in date. It would seem that this type of lock was predominantly continental in origin, with many examples coming from the Netherlands and Germany. It is likely that this example is of a similar date and origin.Reference: Baart, J., Krook, W., Lagerweij, A., Ockersm N., Altena, H., Stam, T., Stoepker, H., Stouthart, G. and Zwan, M. 1977.

The difference in the dies probably arose from the coins having been struck for the Corporation by different persons, or tradesmen, who adopted a little variation in the 'design.' The name is also indifferently spelt, as you know, at that period. No one was permitted to issue these Borough tokens but the Corporation. There was no restriction as to tradespeople issuing their own farthings or tokens, beyond the requirement that the metal or material used, whether lead, pewter, or brass, should of itself fully represent the value of the farthing, under a penalty of forfeiting the whole of them, and a fine of 20s.

The end of the terminal has been decoratively cast to form a gryphon (griffin) or mythical beast. During the Medieval period the drinking horn began to be associated with griffins and is often referred to as Greifenklauen \"because, in popular imagination, the colossal mythical griffin or gryphon had the hind parts of a lion and the foreparts of an eagle, and so large horns were frequently preserved as the talons or claws of this legendary beast. Indeed, it was claimed that their rarity was inevitable because only a saint or a very holy man could obtain one in exchange for curing the griffin of some wound or sickness.\"John Mandeville in his 14th century book 'The Travels of Sir John Mandeville' chapter xxix writes about the land of Bacharia \"In that country be many griffins, more plenty than in any other country. Some men say that they have the body upward as an eagle and beneath as a lion; and truly they say sooth, that they be of that shape. But one griffin hath the body more great and is more strong than eight lions, of such lions as be on this half, and more great and stronger than an hundred eagles such as we have amongst us. For one griffin there will bear, flying to his nest, a great horse, if he may find him at the point, or two oxen yoked together as they go at the plough. For he hath his talons so long and so large and great upon his feet, as though they were horns of great oxen or of bugles or of kine, so that men make cups of them to drink of.

Many horn-badges have been found in England also (including Cat 119, from Salisbury), but their forms, though similar to those found on the continent, are sufficiently distinctive for them to be assigned to an English manifestation of the cult of St Hubert, the patron saint of huntsmen.\" and \"Perhaps such badges were worn for luck in hunting, a favourite medieval pastime, which was celebrated by various other sorts of badges (Cat 194-6).\"References: Spencer, B. 1998.

This is a Poole Group A Type 1c tile. The tile would have covered the ridge line of the roof of a high-status building. The tile is semi-circular in section with four triangular knife cut crests running along the apex of the tile.Dimensions: length: 190mm; width: 100.20mm; thickness: 17mm; weight: 881g.Another crested ridge roof tile on the database is IOW-88F5C8.Poole (2010:11) writes \"A range of different crest forms were identified and were divided into twelve types (figs.4-16). These can be broadly grouped into hand made (Group D: types 4 moulded and 12 thumb-pressed), cut triangular (Group A: types 1, 2, 3 truncated triangle, 8 asymmetric triangle), pyramidal (Group C: type 11) and applied strip with knife stabbing (Group B: types 5 scalloped with aperture, 6 triangular with aperture, 7 individual triangles, 9 solid strip).Some of the forms have identical or close parallels from previous excavations in Southampton: triangular varieties equivalent to type 1 are common (Platt and Coleman-Smith 1975 fig 216. 1416 fig. 217 nos 1429, 1432, 1433). There was one example comparable to type 1b with the base of the crest pierced by a small perforation from High Street, Southampton (Platt and Coleman-Smith 1975 fig. 216 no. 1422) and examples have also been found in Winchester (Poole and Shaffrey, ibid). The most conspicuous are those equivalent to type 5, 6 and 9 (Platt and Coleman-Smith 1975 fig. 214 no. 1407, 1408, 1409).Ridge tiles with knife cut triangular crests are the more usual form and they exhibit considerable variation in size. They have been found at Winchester (Poole and Shaffrey ibid) and were in use at Portchester Castle from the early 13th century through to the post-medieval period. Tiles of this sort were being produced at the Laverstock kilns, though only one of exactly the same height was identified. However, there was limited evidence at Laverstock of 'loop-handled' crest probably equivalent to the type 5 crests. However, since this type is not common outside of Southampton it is more likely to reflect influence from Southampton reaching Laverstock through merchants trading between Southampton and the West country via Salisbury (VCH Wilts vi, 126).The largest number of crested ridge tiles occur in the high medieval phase reflecting their predominance in the 13th to 14th century. A small number (with crest types 1, 5 and 6) found in Anglo-Norman contexts suggests production commenced in the early 13th century. There is a decrease in the late and post- medieval periods, indicating crested ridge tiles continued in use, but it is unclear whether this form of tile was still being produced. An unglazed example with small pyramidal spurs (type11) and a type 1 with incised lines radiating from the spur crest, both from the post-medieval phase of tenement 237 may be late forms. The numbers of any particular crest type are too few to ascertain whether certain varieties were produced at a particular period.\"References: Poole, C. 2010.

In 1656 half penny tokens were introduced. 1674 by Royal decree production of trade tokens ceased. Pers comm Verity AnthonyBerry (1997) writes \"Canteens have been an integral part of British army life for the lower ranks since time immemorial. They certainly existed in the middle of the seventeenth century, being run then by \"sutlers\", who supplied the troops with food, drink and tobacco to supplement the meagre rations doled out by the military. Sutlers were civilians. The word is derived from the Dutch and means a small vendor or petty tradesman. An army ordinance of December 31, 1590, states, \"The Provost Marechal and Sergeant-Major of every garrison shall keep a perfect roll of all such English victuallers called in Dutch sutlers, petty merchants and other loose persons of the English nation.\" William Shakespeare alludes to them in his line, \"I shall sutler be unto the Campe and profits will accrue.\" (Henry V). They seem to have had a particular association with guards' regiments. The London Gazette of 1701 refers to a Mr Wollaston, sutler at Ye Horse Guards.Sutlers had an important role to play in the everyday life of the guards, as J. W. Fortescue points out, \"There was no such thing as an Army Service Corps until the end of the nineteenth century, and all the business of transport and supply was done by contract. In that old battleground of the Coldstream, the Low Countries, a contractor could always be found who knew the business thoroughly. But the contractor was concerned only with the bread and fuel. Everything else was a regimental matter conducted by their regimental sutler, which meant more stoppages, more financial regulations and more accounts. Incidentally, this arrangement must have been bad for discipline, for the soldier who had to pay for his ration of meat, had great temptation to lay violent hands upon every fowl, pig or sheep that came his way. It is worthwhile to note that in the regimental sutler lay the germ of the regimental canteen.\"\"Berry (1997) continues \"Two sutlers' tokens, at least, are directly connected with the other contemporary Guards' regiment, Monk's regiment of foot, which after the Battle of Dunbar had its headquarters at Cold-stream on the Tweed. After the Restoration, the men of this regiment were mustered on Tower Hill and ordered to lay down their arms. Within minutes they were instructed to take them up again, this time as the King's Second Regiment of Foot Guards. The men refused to accept their new designation, insisting that they were second to none! They were then ordered to take up arms as the Lord-General's Regiment of Foot Guards. This remained the regiment's title until 1670, when it became known officially as the Coldstream Guards.General Monk, newly created Duke of Albemarle, had been allotted the post of Lord General of all the forces in England, Scotland and Ireland by the House of Commons in February 1660. A sutler's token issued at the Tilt Yard actually shows a bust of the Duke of Albemarle on the obverse. Although the bust is not clear, its identity is in no doubt as the initials, D. A., appear on either side. The obverse and reverse legends, if joined together as the engraver intended, read, RICHARD WASHBOURNE AT THE TILT YARD SVTTLER 1666 HIS HALFE PENNY R.A.W.Stowe, in his Survey of London of 1598 writes, \"The Leper's Hospital of St James's was surrendered to Henry VIII and the King then built a goodly manor annexing thereunto a park, closed about with a wall of brick now called St James Park, serving indifferently to the said manor and to the manor or palace of Whitehall. South from Charing Cross on the right are divers fair houses lately built before the park, then a large tilt yard for noblemen and others to exercise themselves in jousting, turning and fighting of barriers.\" Thus, St James's Park occupies the site of Henry's tilt yard. Records of both guards' regiments show that troops were regularly kept in the Tilt Yard. In 1699 we read, \"guards were kept at Kennington, Hyde Park, Acton Road, Arlington Gate, Tilt Yard St James, Whitehall, Somerset House, Hampton Court and Windsor, and the allowance for fire and candle paid to Colonel John Shrimpton commanding the First Regiment of Guards.\" In my view, Richard Washbourne provided a canteen service for the Lord General's Regiment of Guards under canvas in St James's Park. At this time, there were few permanent barracks. Soldiers were either provided with tented accommodation or boarded out in private lodgings.\"London County Council (1935:6) write \"In course of time a large proportion of the accommodation at the Horse Guards became used for purposes other than at first intended. A report (fn. n20) by Sir Christopher Wren, dated 4th March, 1712-3, states that stabling had originally been provided for 108 horses, but that at that time there was only room for 62 horses, accommodation for the remaining 46 being used by the sutler at the south end (room for 11 horses), the Paymaster's house and offices at the north-west corner (30 horses), and the Judge Advocate (fn. n21) on the west side (5 horses).\"Reference: Williamson, G.

Having succeeded in this endeavor, in August of 1688 they asked to expand the project to include the \"American Plantations,\" that is, the American colonies. Richard Holt, who acted as the agent for a number of tin mine owners, petitioned the King for the right to produce American Plantations tokens. Holt's petition is extant but we do not have a copy of the royal patent granting him permission to actually produce and distribute the coins. It may be the patent was never granted or simply that it is lost.Unfortunately, without the patent we cannot be sure of the status of these coins. We do know on June 26, 1688 Holt requested the use of Skinner Hall and the use of the minting presses and tools which were there to produce his patterns. This was where James II had produced his regal tin farthings for domestic use. The domestic production had been completed and the lease on the hall was not due to expire until August 8th of that year (subsequently the lease was renewed). Holt employed the engraver John Roettier to design and cut dies for this American Plantations token. On July 27, 1688 Holt sent a letter to the Lord Commissioners of the Treasury with pattern examples of the coin for the King's approval. On August 13th the Commissioners sent the examples to the Officers of the Royal Mint for comment. There are no records after this. We do know that production was started for examples from seven different sets of dies exist. The coins were composed of 97.5% pure tin with an average weight of 135 grains. However, we do not know if the pieces were ever approved or if they were ever shipped to the colonies. Eric Newman has summarized the problem quite well as follows:It is therefore somewhat doubtful whether the circulation of the Plantations farthings was formally approved as no record to that effect has been found. It is also possible that even if approval had been obtained the few remaining months of the reign of James II had elapsed before distribution in America had been planned or carried out. Even though many pieces were struck in anticipation of formal approval and actual distribution it is unsound to conclude that any reached America until evidence of their circulation in the American plantations is found. [Newman, 1964, p. 324]On November 5, 1688 William of Orange landed in England to fight for his claim to the throne. On December 11, 1688 James II fled to France and on January 28, 1689 he was declared to have abdicated the throne and William III and Mary were proclaimed King and Queen. No doubt this abdication precluded either the authorization or the dissemination for any coinage bearing the image of James II, including the American Plantations tokens.Interestingly, this token was not denominated in pence but was valued at 1/24 of a Spanish real, which, in the colonies, would have equalled one and one half farthings. This was done because of the predominance of Spanish coinage in the colonies and the hope that it would improve acceptance of the new coin. In British documents discussing the production of this piece it is generally referred to as a \"farthing.\"The obverse of the coin shows James II on horseback with the legend, IACOBVS . II . D G . MAG . BRI . FRAN . ET . HIB . REX . (James II by the grace of God King of Great Britain, France and Ireland). On the reverse are the four crowned shields of England, Scotland, France and Ireland (clockwise from top) linked together with chains and the legend, VAL . 24 PART . REAL . HISPAN . (translated as: Value a 24th part of a Spanish real). Beads similar to those found on the obverse and reverse rim were added to the edge. Eric Newman has identified seven obverse (1-7) and seven reverse (A-G) dies used for the American Plantations token. The combinations are 1-A, 2-B, 2-G, 3-C, 4-D, 4-E, 5-D, 6-F and 7-F. The differences in the obverses are primarily based on the specific position of the head in relation to the letters in the legend while the reverses are distinguished by the number of strings on the harp (A has 6 strings, B has 7, C has 8, D has 11, E has 7, F has 6 and G has 5). Newman reverse die C has a sideways 4 and Newman reverse die G has the Irish harp and Scottish lion rampant shields transposed. A and F can be distinguised in that the lowest lion's head is left of the two others on A and to the right on F. Varieties 1-A, 2-G, and 3-C are very rare.In 1828 the London coin dealer Matthew Young obtained many of the Roettier dies. He then sold most of the coin and metal dies to the British Museum. Among these dies he apparently acquired and retained two pairs of the original American Plantations token dies as well as the bars used to make the beaded edge. From these dies he produced a few hundred restrikes in a pewter based metal. The majority of the restrikes are 5-D but he also made some examples of 4-D and 4-E. Besides the metal composition restrikes can be identified in that they are usually in much better condition that the original tokens. Tin is a poor metal for coins in that it corrodes easily, especially in colder climates. Most of the restrikes (made with obverse 5) show a break in the die on the obverse as in the example on the following page.\"Information also found at http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIntros/AmPlant.intro.html","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.030086,51.501606],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/1fd4caf5-deaf-4b91-b51b-89bf392cfcd7","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"DISH","id":853351,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/853351","description":"A Medieval to Post Medieval lead alloy (pewter) small dish, probably dating to the 15th-17th century.

The clasp consists of a pierced rounded centre with a pierced terminal in the form of a stylised animal head. The strap end section is formed from folded sheet metal and is broadly rectangular in plan, slightly widening towards the attachment end which is concave. At the attachment end, there is a rivet hole in each corner, one rivet now missing. At the opposite end the plate is bent in half over the hinge back and the corners are recessed to fit the arms of the clasp terminal which go over the ends of the hinge bar.The solid cast terminal is D-shaped in plan with a circular hole running through the centre. It thins slightly towards the straight edge which is adjacent to the strap end and from the corners of the edge project two short arms which are transversely pieced to fit over the ends of the hinge. Projecting from the middle of the curve of the D there is a long thicker knop, rectangular in plan but in profile shaped into a very crude animal head. This knop has a circular hole through it in profile so set at right angles to the hole though the main part of the terminal. The pierced rounded centre is called a 'loop' by Egan.The clasp would have been attached to a strap fixed to one cover of the book, and fitted over a peg mounted on the opposite cover (Egan 1998:279, fig. 919-925). It is thought that the pierced terminal may have held a cord to help in removing the clasp from the peg (Egan 1998:278).Dimensions: length: 47.39mm; width: 11.60mm; thickness: 5.34mm; weight: 8.20gSimilar clasps on the database are SOM-4F6A0C and DEV-91DE41.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.02907,51.488697],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/be1d84b9-6c8c-4a00-881e-8dfa33137fcc","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"TOY","id":842690,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/842690","description":"A Post Medieval lead alloy toy watch dating AD1630-1650.

Lewis (2014:145) writes \"The relic of St John the Baptist's head on a charger inspired the design of many pilgrim badges associated with his cult at Amiens. The form of charger probably explains their circular form. Upon them is the image of the forward-facing head of St John the Baptist. \"Over-large, protruding eyes\" are a feature of such badges, which Brian Spencer suggests might betray roots in the \"popular belief that a saint with a menacing look and with huge, staring eyes, would give better protection against infections and other ailments by repelling evil spirits\".

The fragment consists of an eight-spoked wheel, with a driver sitting above. Another piece of the toy protrudes from the lower-right edge of the wheel, probably part of the stand, however it is bent backwards behind the wheel. The wheel has a raised pellet in the centre and where each spoke meets the wheel hoop. The driver is right-facing, dressed in a broad, cocked hat and long coat and has it's arms extrented outwards holding the reigns. There is a moulded-relief decoration on the driver, consisting of buttons, an arm, facial features and clothing outlines. The protruding part from the lower-right side of the wheel, presumably the stand, is inscribed with the letter H with a horizontal line above and below, probably indicating the maker. This letter is on the rear side, however due to this part being bent backwards it is visible from the front-side on the toy.This example appears to have been part of a flat, two-dimensional version of a toy horse and carriage. An example with the same makers initial is shown in Forsyth & Egan (2005; 321, fig 10.11) Type 3 Design 1 and is dated to the 18th century.

In relation to this, it is curious to observe that the first and most precisely dated finds of Tuscan marbleized pottery occurred in Great Britain - more than 50 different sites - and even in the British colony of Virginia in North America, in a context dated 1620- 1640 (Hurst et al 1986, 33) - and in Holland where it has been identified in numerous contexts dated from 1575 to 1650 (ibid 33-37; Baart 1985, 161-186, gs.24- 25). These finds consist of simple bowls and basins with a curled rim and a particular type of pilgrim's flask with four loops on the sides that British scholars call lion-headed costrels (Hurst et al 1986, 37, Berti 1997, 376, Tipo Cc 2 and g. 33/4) (Figure 2).\"Blake (1981:105) writes \"So far few marbled closed forms have been found in north Tuscany and Liguria.

The arms are rectangular-section, with the lower arm having an extinguishing tray that projects upwards. The tray rises at 90 degrees from the arm, before constricting inwards on both sides, then flaring out slightly again before leading to a rounded upper part.

The object is circular and has a flat flange, shallow curving wall and a flat, rounded base. The front of the plate/charger has a raised, moulded-relief decoration, comprising of a scrolling foliate design around the flange and a beaded edge. The base is decorated with a trapezoidal basket or flower pot, which itself has a hatch decoration and a pellet on each of the four corners, and has foliage rising from within. This is all within a circular, beaded border which has lines radiating from its outer edge towards the flange. The reverse side is undecorated. The toy has been crushed and deformed so it is hard to determine how deep the wall would have been, however the narrow space between the decoration on the flange and the base would suggest it would have been fairly shallow. It has an overall golden-brown colour, which is the result of tin sulphide discoloration from the Thames, also known as \"nature's gilding\".No exact parallels could be found in Forsyth & Egan (2005) or on the database. Forsyth & Egan (2005:no.8.66 and 8.80-8.81) show examples with a similar style of decoration on the base, all of which have an 18th century date. The flange decoration however is similar to no.8.44, although this example doesn't have a decorated base, and has a date of AD1680-1700. None of the 17th century plates/chargers illustrated in Forsyth & Egan (2005) have a similarly decorated base.

The style of the chair is similar to Thomas Chippendale's ribband back chairs of this time period. The object consists of the back of the chair and seat cast in one piece, with the legs missing. The back stiles are semi-circular in section and initially protrude from the seat vertically, then curve outwards towards the top rail, meeting it at a corner. The top rail is double curved (upwards) with an ellipse. There is a circular motif in both corners of the top rail and at the top of the ellipse. The splat (vertical central element of a chair back) has a symetrical, ribbon style design. It consists of 2 bars connected to the back of the seat at a v-shape, which taper inwards and then curve outwards to form a sub-circular shape in the centre of the splat. The bars then taper inwards again to a point of meeting, with the ends of the bars flaring slightly outwards. Within the sub-circular shape created, there is a pierced lozenge shape with each of the corners connected to the sub-circle shape. The centre sub-circle is connected to the stiles of the chair by two vertical bars on either side. There is another bar on either side which connects the upper part of the stile to the ellipse, bending at a corner to avoid meeting the flare on the splat design. The seat of the chair is trapezoidal in plan, with the front and both sides bent over at almost right-angles. On the front bend there are two stumps where the front two legs, now missing, once connected. The back of the chair is bent upright to approximately 120 degrees from the seat. The splat and stiles are decorated with a molded-relief design consisting of a beaded design on the splat and top rail, and four-pelleted flower motifs within a circle on the stiles. There is a flower motif where the vertcial bars join the central sub-circular shape. The seat of the chair is decorated with a repeated pattern comprising of lozenges in a grid pattern. Each lozenge has a pellet in the centre. The decoration of the seat may be representing a cushion, as examples of the chairs the toy is likely to be copying have a cushioned seat (Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection). This decoration continues onto the front bend. The object is a dark grey colour with golden patches which are the result of tin sulphide discoloration from the Thames, also known as \"nature's gilding\".A similar style of chair is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection: Accession number: 64.101.983, .984, with a date of AD1755-1760.

The reverse is also very worn, but the image appears to be segmented by horizontal and vertical lines. It is not possible to determine the die axis as the coin is too worn.As a parallel record (CORN-9B4BD1) suggests: in the mid-16th century major silver deposits were found in South America, in an area known as 'Peru', but this relates to an area much larger than modern-day Peru.

The spoon is complete with bowl, stem and figurative terminal. The figure at the top of the spoon is cast and stands on a small dais or column (made from the top of the stem which is oval in section). The figure is roughly oval in plan and sub-oval in cross section. The figure is dressed in a loose fitting gown holding a cup or chalice. The earliest dated set of Apostle Spoons is 1493 AD, but they were most popular from 1500 AD to 1660's AD. Complete sets consisted of all twelve Apostles and the Saviour or the Virgin Mary. They were commonly given as Christening gifts, either as a full set by the wealthy or just as a single spoon by the less affluent. For the most part, these spoons were made individually. Wealthy grandparents would buy one spoon representing a babies \"apostle\" and it would be their Christening present. This spoon would be used only by that person and it would be kept for life. Consequently most of the old apostle spoons show considerable wear both at the finial and at the bowl. The phrase \"to be born with a silver spoon\" stems from this tradition. Initially they were made from silver, but examples made from pewter or copper alloy are known. It does not appear to be Jesus and is most likely to be the apostle John holding the cup of sorrow.Similar examples of apostle spoons have been dated to the late 15th Century (1450 ->).

The flared end widens to form a stretched trapezoid with six removes of different shapes from the outer edge. At the flared end of the object, there are 2 rivets of the same alloy still intact. The front surface is decorated with an engraved linear pattern comprising 3 isoceles triangles, with a remove being at the centre-bottom of each triangle, pointing towards the middle of the clasp from the expanded end. Each triangle has a line down its centre, with diagonal lines either side pointing towards the remove. 3 lines flare out from either side of the middle triangle towards the centre, and a parallel line runs down the outside edge of both outside triangles. At the hooked end of the clasp, there are two parallel engraved lines running from top to bottom of the object. Several other lines run perpendicular to the inner of these 2 lines, pointing towards the middle of the clasp, and get gradually shorter towards the middle of the midline of the clasp. A rivet of the same alloy is still intact at the end of these shortest lines.

The obverse of the coin is poorly executed image of a laureate head, the features are large and lack any definition. There are crude letters in the border forming a legend but again they are large and the legend is nonsensicle. The reverse appears to have a stylised crown in the center, shape like the letter B laid sideways and surrounded by pellets. The object is cast as a mould line is visible around the edge of the coin which is of irregular thickness, essentially wedge shaped in section.The object has been examined by Dr. Sam Moorhead and Dr. Vincent Drost, British Museum, who are confident that the coin is not Roman nor even an ancient copy. The material suggests a later forgery of 'Billy and Charley' who began using copper alloys,so called 'cock metal' a Copper/lead (2/1) mix to make their forgeries by AD1864 (Halliday 1986). The object has a dark olive green colour consistent with a copper alloy. The surface of the object is pitted and uneven. It is not known quite how many forgeries were produced by Billy and Charley between AD.1857-1871 but estimates are between 5000-10,000 and they seem to have favoured forging predominantly medieval objects.

This aglet is constructed from a gold cylinder; there is no visible seam where the two ends meet. The majority of the body of the aglet has no decoration except a band of decoration at the open end and a filigree cage at the opposite end. The band of decoration at the open end comprises two bands of twisted rope filigree with pellets regularly spaced between them. There are two holes for attachment on opposing sides of the cylinder. There is a small hole next to one of the attachment perforations but this appears to be a flaw during manufacture. The other end is closed by a filigree cage in the shape of an eight-petalled flower (comprising eight wire pointed ovals radiating from a central pellet). The shape of the aglet is squashed along the length and there are cracks near the middle.Dimensions: length: 14.76mm; width: 5.76mm; weight: 0.54g.As the aglet is greater than 300 years old and is more than 10% gold it fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act 1996.This aglet is part of a group all found on the same stretch of foreshore, this group includes:5 gold aglets (LON-F2F3A4 2011T44; LON-FE3341 2013T403; LON-E7ED18 2015T860; LON-5E0F81 2015T939; LON-A11C64 2016T154), 1 fragment of a gold aglet (LON-EA7160), 1 miniature gold aglet with enamel (LON-E9FF18).\t2 open work gold beads (LON-16E77 2015T982, LON-86CA6E), one with an inlaid piece of glass.\t1 gold floral decorative element with enamel (LON-17CDF 2015T982)\t2 gold fragments of filigree work (LON-86CD94; LON-811333 2016T154)Aglets are ornaments used at the end of points (laces) to secure a garment. They are decorative and often found in pairs on hats, doublets or dresses. Parallels can be found in contemporary portraits by Holbein shown on sleeves and skirts. Hans Eworth in a portrait of Mary I (AD1555) shows the sleeves of her dress aglets like these arranged in pairs covering the surface.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.008316,51.484204],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/4949324f-0b48-4733-8e81-fa0d44acc0f8","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"COIN","id":753948,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/753948","description":"Post medieval copper alloy coin of Phillip IV of Spain and the Spanish Netherlands (AD 1621-1665) valuing 16 Maravedis dated AD 1664.

This aglet is an openwork design where there are two rows of lozenges with a solid band between, at the end there is another solid band with the same decoration and a solid cap terminal. It is possible there was a solid band above the final row of lozenges that is now missing. The lozenges are made from a lozenge-shaped piece of sheet gold with filigree work (twisted gold wire) around the edge forming a cell. It is possible there was another material inlaid in the middle, however there is no evidence remaining. The two solid bands are decorated again with filigree work, this time comprising wire that has been coiled to form a spiral and this is laid on its side forming a raised pattern. There are similar solid bands with this coiled filigree work on LON-EA7160, LON-0D052B and LON-E7ED18 which were found associated with this object. The distal end is closed by a solid cap that is a decorated with a filigree six-petalled flower (comprising twisted gold wire forming six pointed ovals radiating from a central pellet, there is a twisted wire ring forming a border around the central pellet). This end cap is similar to LON-E7ED18 however that example is open work rather than solid. The aglet is damaged and squashed distorting the overall shape, sections of the upper row of lozenges are missing and the upper edge of the aglet also appears to be missing.Dimensions: length: 14.80mm; width: 7.50mm; thickness: 3.81mm; weight: 0.41g.As the aglet is greater than 300 years old and is more than 10% gold it fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act 1996.This aglet was found at the same time and in the same place as LON-811333, a filigree circular decorative element.

This shoe is very worn and has been repaired heavily suggesting this shoe was worn and handed on to be worn by someone else. The outer sole is missing the left hand edge and part of the toe due to damage. There is a hole in the leather under the ball of the foot and it is heavily worn with parts missing from the left hand edge of the heel; these two are due to heavy wear. There are stitchmarks around the edge of the outer sole as part of the original construction of the shoe; there are also stitchmarks diagonally across the heel which indicates the presence of a patch sole repair to create a clump sole. There is a further repair around the inner edge of the heel, indicated by another row of stitchmarks. On the insole there is a small area of the heel that is broken and missing due to damage. There is some wear on the ball of the foot that matches the hole in the outersole and there a line of stitchmarks across the heel that match the repair on the outersole. The two conjoining fragments of the vamp have stitchmarks along the sides for attachment to the sole and also along the outer corner of the edge nearest the instep for attachment to the heel section. There is a cut across the toe and the toe section is no longer present; this may be due to slashed decoration or it might be the toe was deliberately removed by the owner to increase fit(especially pertinant if this shoe was second hand).

The mounts are of a range of shapes and all have incised decoration on one side only. They probably come from a box and have evidence on the reverse of file marks, used to ensure they were secure. All have a dark brown pattination and are in various states of completeness.1. The square mount has a central circular perforation, which probably would have contained a rivet. There is an engraved circle running around the perforation with a cross extending outwards from it, the ends meeting the edges of the mount. In between the cross arms are further radiating lines of different lengths, with a peak in the middle.2. The trapezoidal mount has a rounded rectangular perforation along one of the longest edges. Either side of the perforation are double vertical lines. This mount was likely from the hinge or handle section of the box based on the shape of the perforation. There is a crack at one of the shortest edges and another forming at the opposite end.3. The rectangular mount has a single engraved line at one of the shortest edges, with a double line engraved slightly further down. Beneath the lines is a carved foliate design that appears to resemble a willow tree. However, the decoration would have continued onto another panel so it is difficult to discern the entire design. There is also a break at one of the corners of the end with linear decoration. This piece is slightly bent due to extensive deposition in water.4. The complete asymmetrical mount consists of a rounded shaped section with a knop at the end and a collar separating it from an elongated oval shaped section. The second section tapers before forking out either side of a pointed oval terminal. The engraved decoration is very worn but, upon comparison with the other similar pieces, appears to be a foliate design.5. Part of an almost identical mount to number four, consisting of a round and elongated oval section separated by a collar. The decoration of the collar is more pronounced in this example, consisting of a double engraved line with diagonal lines running through the centre. The foliate design appears across the rest of this piece. There is a break at either end of the mount, but it is highly likely this would have been the same size and shape as mount four.6. This mount is very similar to mounts four and five. It consists of an elongated oval section, tapering at one end before flaring out again, with a rounded knop at the opposite end. The mount is decorated in a foliate design, which appears to show branches in the centre with the outline of the canopy formed by dashed lines running around the branches. The mount is broken at the flaring end, so it's original shape and size is unclear.7. The pointed oval terminal of a similar mount to four, five and six. It is possible that this fragment belongs to either five or six, though it does not fit the break on either. There is a carved line at the broken end with a radiating design, the longest line being in the centre. It appears this piece is also following the foliate decoration on the other pieces.Many similar mounts have been found on the foreshore in front of the Tower of London, often dated to the later Medieval period. However, the identification of a figural mount found in the same vicinity depicting a man wearing late 16th or early 17th century dress (LON-2F1FB2) suggests these are more likely to be later in date.

The object is decorated on one side only, with a border running around the edge and a foliate design that appears to form an oval shape just within the band. There appears to be writing within the border, though this is now illegible. In the centre is an image with radiating lines surrounding it, though now it is impossible to discern the central image. Below the radiating lines is an open circle, like the symbol omega, and a pellet beneath. The object has a mid-dark grey pattination and has been irregularly broken, with damage to the edges.No parallels can be found for this object and it is not clear whether it is in fact a pilgrim badge as there is no evidence for attachment. However, it is likely that this is a fragment from a pilgrim badge based on the style of decoraiton.

This is a type 1, design 2 toy musket (Forsyth and Egan, 2005, 91). It is solidly cast, consisting of a fishtail butt, cylindrical barrel with three facets on the top, an open circular pan and a rectangular trigger guard. On the upper side of the musket, there is a ridge at the breech, curving around the open pan. Along the side of the barrel, next to the pan, is a pronounced semi-circular ridge. Half-way along the upper barrel are two pairs of transverse grooves, leaving a gap in the decoration. There is a muzzle ring formed of an engraved line. On the underside, there is another transverse groove near the muzzle, with a further two at the end of the stock. The two sets of engraving underneath are located next to ridges that mark the main body of the barrel. Forsyth and Egan note that these lower engravings may represent ramrod pipes (ibid.).The stock is decorated with punched ring and dot motifs; three on either side of the butt, three along the stock and one underneath, just before the trigger guard. The top of the barrel is decorated with a wavy line running down the centre and scrolling decoration on the facets either side. The section between the sets of engraved lines is blank.

The barrel is cylindrical, faceted at one end to form three panels on the top. The barrel tapers from the faceted end to the centre and flares to the muzzle. There is part of the iron firing mechanism still connected to the barrel at the faceted end. The mechanism is rectangular with a broken rectangular projection at the top and a semi-circular indentation below. The edges of this iron mechanism are worn, showing a laminated texture beneath. At the muzzle end of the barrel are two projections, an oval projection at the top and squared projection beneath. Underneath the faceted section are three maker's marks and a circular perforation where the handle of the pistol would have attached. The maker's marks are the initials \"A.G.\", \"L.LIBRE\" and three equal armed crosses beneath a foliate design with a crown above. Next to the A.G. mark there appears to be the word \"Vil\" scratched in a much cruder style to the decoration. Other than the breaks on the iron projection there is damage on the base of the barrel, which is squared and appears to have been caused by scraping. It is unlikely this is an attachment that has fallen off as the edges of the break are unclean. There are minor scratches across the surface and patches of mid-dark brown discolouration along the barrel. The rest of the barrel has a golden pattination.The barrel is decorated on the facets with a double engraved line separating the panels from the rest of the barrel and a further line roughly 4mm down the barrel. The panels are separated with linear engravings and there are swirls or semi-circles at the ends of the panels.

The break at the tip is not clean and the tip has been pinched so that the hole is not its original shape. Above the tip is a double collar, with an identical double collar half way along the barrel. Decorating the object are two double pairs of engraved lines running around the barrel between the central collars and the tip and the central collars and the flange. These pairs are evenly spaced along the barrel. Further decorations appear to have been added at a later stage, in the form of engraved lines radiating from the central collar towards the tip.

The object is composed of a section of blade, with a separate fragment associated, a decorative bolster and squared tang. The blade has a thick edge, tapering to the blade edge, and appears to taper to the tip of the blade. The bolster is molded into two reels and separates the blade from the tang. The tang is squared and tapers to a point, though the end has been damaged so that there appears to be a rounded nodule on the end. The blade has been significantly damaged with an irregular break pattern. There is a large amount of mid-grey concretion at the section where the bolster meets the blade, as well as along the tang. The knife has a black pattination with patches of orange-red corrosion across the surface.A similar knife, with a double reel decoration on the bolster, can be found in Margeson (1993, no. 871) and dates AD 1600-1650. A similarly decorative bolster can also be found in Brown (2001, Fig. 39b) and is also of an early 17th century date.Dimensions:Knife - length: 97.91 mm; width: 20.66 mm; blade thickness: 3.59 mm; weight: 22.34g.Fragment - length: 21.80 mm; width: 17.16 mm; weight: 2.16g.Reference: Brown, P. 2001.

The bolster is decorated with a series of pellets running in two rows around the object. The blade has a black pattination and there are patches of red-orange corrosion product across the surface. There are cracks running down the ivory handle, but it is still attached to the tang, and is discoloured on one side to a mid-dark grey.The narrow blade and the bolster/tang configuration suggests an early Post Medieval date, AD 1550 to 1650.

Half of the bell remains, which consists of a hemispherical body with a separate suspension loop. The loop is formed of a rectangular strip of copper alloy which has been threaded through a slit at the peak of the bell. The edge of the shell has been folded to form a decorative rim, and probably would have attached the two halves of the bell together. There is a trace of lead solder inside the bell which was probably used to secure the strip to the inside of the bell. The pea would have been separate within the body.Based on the size, this may be a Hawking bell or may have been on the collar of a small domestic animal. Similar examples can be found on the PAS database (WMID-D1C241 and SOM-E4DCB3) which date this type of bell to the 15th-16th centuries.

On the right edge of the outer face is the remains of a loop. This may have acted as a hinge for the chest, with an axial bar running through it. The object is decorated with molded beading running around the edge of the entire object.There are breaks at the base of the object, where the legs would have projected, and along the opposite edge to the loop.

The front of the clasp is decorated with a single stamped concentric circle motif towards the fantail end of the rectangular section.

There is a separate copper alloy rivet near the hooked end and a separate iron rivet towards the flared end. Both rivets are connected to an iron plate that would have kept the clasp attached to the book. The iron plate has significant damage around its edges, so its original shape and size are uncertain.

The flute is carved of a tibia, probably from a sheep or goat. The bone is cylindrical, flaring at one end to form a trefoil. The calcareous material in the centre of the bone has been removed. At the flared end, the cork fipple is still in situ creating the blow-hole. Fipples are used to regulate the breath passing through the instrument and are rarely found in place (MacGregor, 1985, 150). There is a square perforation on the shin side of the bone to form a finger-hole.Similar examples can be found in MacGregor (1985, 149) and are predominantly medieval in date. A further example of an ovi-caprid tibia flute found in Egan (1998, 288, Fig 219) is of 11th century date. Also, a similar example in the Museum of London teaching collections is of medieval date (A22674).Hazel Forsyth: \"It is clear that the bone has some kind of block at the proximal end which seems to be made of cork ( at least it has the characteristics of cork and it is difficult to think what else it could be). For it to work as a pipe or perhaps, more correctly a whistle, the block (or fipple) has to have a breathing slot. We (the conservators and Hazel) have looked at the block under the microscope and there is the merest suggestion of a slot, though whether this is a deliberate cut or the product of decay or accident is unclear. The incision is not only indistinct but also seems to be partly formed; there is no way of knowing whether it penetrates all the way through the block to the window. There are no thumb or tone holes and so perhaps, the 'flute' should be categorized as a whistle (if indeed there is a slot in the fipple). If the stopped end is a fipple it would be possible to achieve a double octave from this pipe with constant breath, over-breathing and under-breathing - and I imagine it would be possible to alter the timbre with finger pressure across the open end. It could conceivably have been used in the manner of a tabor pipe or drone.Helen Leaf has made a particular study of these objects (see Galpin Soc. Journal) and notes that the 'earliest of these ?utes dates from the ?fth century and the latest is post-medieval. There is a peak of occurrence in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They have been found in a wide range of site types; from elite sites such as castles, manor houses and monastic sites, but also from rural sites such as small villages and settlements.' I suspect they are still in use in the Urals, Carpathians and other remote places; so dating is problematic.The use of cork for a block is perhaps significant (all of the recorded examples from Continental Europe have fipples of bees wax, wood and, more rarely clay. The medieval port books mention imports of cork but the presence of cork in this piece may suggest an Iberian or Mediterranean attribution - and its presence in London - perhaps a sailor's pipe lost overboard?The pipe is certainly intriguing but for the reasons given above, I cannot be completely sure of its function. It could be a partially worked item.\"Dimensions: length: 153.65 mm; internal diameter at open end: 8.59 mm; blow-hole width: 25.39 mm; weight: 41.19g.Reference: MacGregor, A. 1985.

This button is decoratively made to resemble a Tudor rose. The rose is constructed from five different elements forming four concentric roses that decrease in size that are stacked on top of each other with a central rounded knop. Each of the roses has five heart-shaped petals and the largest, outer rose has five pointed calyxs, one in between each of the petals. On the edges of all the petals and the calyxs there is a piece of filigree resembling twisted rope forming a border. There is no other decoration except on the calyxs which also have a piece of filigree forming a small scroll in the centre. There is a little damage in the form of small holes on three of the petals of the second largest rose. The shape of some of the petals of the largest rose is slightly distorted. On the reverse of the button there is a circular shank for attachment. The shank is constructed from a piece of wire and soldered into place. This has been bent out of alignment so that it now lies flat against the back of the button.The filigree decoration is similar to that on the ball-headed pins and the trefoil-shaped hooked tags of the 16th century (Read 2005:122). Hazel Forsyth (pers comm) agrees with a 16th century date and suggests this button may have been used to ornament a hat or sleeves.As the button is greater than 300 years old and is more than 10% gold it fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act 1996.Dimensions: thickness: 7.44mm; diameter: 18.67mm; weight: 2.03g.Reference: Read, B. 2005.

The pin that would have held the dividing arms together is missing. The arms are decoratively cast so that they have a varied, faceted appearance. On the middle section of the arms this faceting has created an oval depression on both the front and back surfaces.

There is a linear decoration separating the handle from the blade and a double linear decoration separating the trefoil and the handle.There are no exact parallels for this object. MacGregor notes that the only known Ivory knife in Britain comes from a 5th-6th century context (1985, 183). Trefoil terminals, as seen on this example, can be found on Early-Medieval to Modern knives. Similarly, ring and dot motifs are ubiquitous throughout history. However, examples of Victorian page turners seem to show spatulate style ivory objects being used for a different function.

It consists of three parts: a rectangular tang, a hollow ground lozenge-shaped blade and a needle point. The point was made by twisting the end of the blade. The shape resembles three possible medieval daggers. The rondel dagger was popular from the 14th century onwards and is identifiable by the rounded pommel and handguard (Weland, 2001, 90), which are no longer present. The stiletto was a later form of the rondel dagger, identifiable by a triangular cross section (Ibid, 2001, 92). This blade matches the stiletto, however stilettos tended to have an integrally cast handgrip, which this example does not have. A further parallel can be found in the Misericorde, a common choice of dagger in the 14th century (Lacombe, 1870, 311). This is another derivative of the rondel, made thin enough to fit through the gaps in armour. Without the other features of the weapon present, as well as the amount of corrosion material covering the object, it is difficult to accurately identify it.Blades from Spain and Germany have been known to change in section along the blade but not in this style. It has been suggested that this may be a later modification or this item could in fact be a medical instrument (Hazel Forsyth, pers. comm. 6th January 2014).

The circular frame is decorated with pellets within a linear border around the inner and outer edges. There is one surviving circular lobe projecting from the outer edge of the frame; this is decorated with a central ring and dot motif. The outer edge of the frame is uneven suggesting there may originally have been more decorative projections. The head of Becket is similar to other published examples with the stylised moustache and down-turned mouth. LOcks of hair are depicted on his foreshead and at the temples. The mitre and amice is decorated with a zigzag pattern with pellets in each of the triangular cells, ring and dot motifs and a central fleur de lys on the mitre. There is a small hole on the temple which is due to a casting flaw.Spencer (1998:103) writes: \"Several hundred badges commemorating the head reliquary have been found at London alone, and surprisingly few of them are mould-matches.

The shoulder below the band of decoration is also decorated with a grooved band, creating a border for the foliate design. The vessel has holes in the base and lower side.These bird troughs date to the 15th -17th century, and decorated examples tend to be earlier in date. A trough with similar decoration was found in an unstratified layer in London (Egan 2005, 129 ref no. 617). This example is likely 16th century in date.

The rotary arm is circular with a flattened tab at one end with a central square perforation through which the internal lock will pass when it is in place. The opposite end has been wrapped around the axis bar to form a hinge.The body of the lock has a front and back plate and a side strip that separates the two plates; as a whole, this encloses the rotary mechanism.

One tab is attached to the upper-middle of the front plate and would have been used to open or close the lock by swinging the plate over and away from the key-hole.

The punches then continue approximately two thirds of the way down the walls with an incised line forming a border below.  Below the incised line there is a decorative line of stamped triangles, then a plain border and finally two more rows of stamped triangles; the upper row are smaller triangles than the others with the points facing down and the low row are larger triangles with the points facing up; followed by an incised line.  The punches are very worn, almost completely worn away in some areas, on the top of the thimble more punches have been created.  These punches are larger and cruder than the original punches.  The punches appear to have been created in rows of 4, set at angles to each other creating an irregular sub-circular pattern.  There is a little distortion to the rim but this may have occurred post depositionally.  Similar thimbles are illustrated in Margeson (1993:188 fig139) and Egan (2005:132 no. 643), these examples are listed as being made in Nuremburg during the 16th century with the ones from Norwich being found in a mid 17th century rubbish pit.

The maker's mark is a star/asterisk motif with the number \"29\" beneath.Pistol grip knives are believed to dominate in the late 17th and early 18th centuries (Brown, 2001, 101). Some similar knives are noted throughout (pages 102-109) though the designs are more elaborate and constructed of different materials.

This is a flat curry comb with 7 wrought bars and 2 knockers, the handle is broken and missing. This curry comb comprises a flat rectangular back plate, the longer edges are folded over and the a row of triangular teeth have been cut into the edge. There are five further toothed bars that have been riveted onto the back plate. The ends of the central toothed bar project around to the back surface of the back plate and terminate in solid knops that form the knockers. Only one is surviving. The handle was also riveted to the back plate, on the opposite side to the teeth. The handle had an elaborate terminal that is still attached to the back plate. This terminal forms a cross-shape with three flaring arms and one smaller, triangular shaped arm with decorative triangular cutouts. The upper arm that would have formed the base of the handle has a central raised rib. There are three surviving rivets which have domed heads; two in the upper arm and one central to the cross. There are semi-circular cutouts in the three other arms which originally may have housed rivets. Small areas of the back plate are missing and one of the shorter edges has been damaged and now curls back on itself.A similar example is illustrated in Clark (1995:161 fig. 119) as part of a 1929 catalogue of stable equipment. Clark writes \"a comb of this flat type is reported from a post medieval (17th or early 18th century) context at Ardingly (W. Sussex), comparte two examples from Jamestown, Virginia.\" John Clark has studied this example and he is happy with a date of 17th - early 18th century although he notes that the type continues into the early 20th century.

The floral pattern can be observed in a number of object types from the Medieval period and is not exclusively for strap mounts.

This whistle has been constructed from three pieces of sheet silver. The first piece has been rolled to form a tapering cylinder and shaped to form a D-shaped mouthpiece. The second piece is circular and forms a domed end cap to close the open end opposite the mouthpiece. The third piece sits internally running from the mouthpiece to the front edge of the D-shaped sound hole that has been cut away in the upper surface of the whistle. Directly underneath the sound hole on the lower surface of the whistle there is a circular loop soldered on through which articulates a ring made from silver wire. There is a maker's mark stamped into the silver on the upper surface of the whistle adjacent to the mouthpiece. The maker's mark comprises the initials IH. There are two further initials carved into the lower, angled section of the mouthpiece. These initials are EC and may be the owner's initials. There are some dents that slightly distort the overall shape of the whistle.Dimensions:Length: 36.77mm; width of mouthpiece: 7.03mm; diameter at the endcap: 8.98mm; diameter of suspension ring: 11.22mm; weight: 3.04g.Discussion:This whistle can be compared with a fragmentary whistle, also with a maker's mark, reported through the Treasure Act from Lincolnshire, (TAR 2004, no. 346; 2004T253; NLM-7881F0) and a more complete whistle, also marked, from West Sussex, (TAR 1998-9, no. 242). Both these whistles are described as being 17th-century hunting whistles. They could also have been used for hawking. NLM-7881F0 is also marked with the owner's initials.A more ornate example is 2008 T221 (HESH-2422D7). Compare also 2007W21 (was NMGW-9F1A17; now apparently HESH-CED3B4). Other similar examples include SWYOR-E026C4 and HAMP3697.As the whistle is greater than 300 years old and is more than 10% silver it fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act 1996.Kate Sumnall, Finds Liaison Officer for Greater London, Museum of London, 15.09.14","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.056575,51.499362],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/4f6b7acd-310f-4a11-b9d7-bd3d7e6ff640","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"WHISTLE","id":559434,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/559434","description":"A Post Medieval lead alloy whistle probably dating 16th - 17th century.

On each side of this circular terminal a five petalled flower, a rose, has been engraved.  The rose has a cross-hatched centre and a pointed calyx projecting between each petal.  The arms are decoratively cast so that they have a varied, faceted appearance. On the middle section of the arms this faceting has created an oval depression on both the front and back surfaces. There is no evidence of a maker's mark.Similar dividers are recorded on the database e.g. LON-B94FC8, LON-EAE3C3, NMS-33A118.Dimensions: length: 105.89mm; width: 16.82mm; thickness: 10.37mm; weight: 51.60g.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.054061,51.498743],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/fe833538-1e75-4abd-8382-5cc4de6c73f0","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"COIN","id":559348,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/559348","description":"A post-medieval silver approximately quartered coin, probably Philippe V of Spain (1700-24); denomination: 2 reales.Dimensions: length: 13.48mm; width: 13.82mm; weight: 0.78g.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.048056,51.499007],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/3a9af2e0-0050-469f-933f-61af19fc497f","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"COIN","id":559347,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/559347","description":"A Post Medieval silver shilling of James I (AD1603-1625).

The pin is broken across the shank and the point is broken and missing. The perforated end is bent over and the terminal is partially wrapped around the shank forming a loop. This looks like it might be a deliberate alteration. The surviving length of the pin has a rectangular slot with a groove following the line of the slot above and below; this slot sits just below the terminal. The shaft tapers towards the break and there is a sideways bend just above the break. The break is worn. There is no decoration on this pin and there does not appear to be a scoop terminal. If this pin is deliberately altered it could function as a replacement pin for a brooch or a buckle.Margeson (1993:8) writes that these have previously been called 'bodkins' which is a term generally assumed to relate to needlework. The term applies both to needlework and to head-dress or hair pins. The above type of pin is similar in form but not decoration to those that were used as head-dress ornaments in the Low Countries in the first quarter of the 17th century. It is thought they were brought to England by immigrants. Baart et al (1977:217) illustrates a similar plain example but still with the scoop terminal that dates to the first half of the 17th century.As the pin is greater than 300 years old and is more than 10% silver it fulfils the requirements of the Treasure Act 1996.Dimensions: length: 39.24mm; width: 3.15mm; thickness: 1.30mm; weight: 1.14g.Reference: Margeson, S.1993.

This shoe consists of the forepart and waist of the sole and insole and the vamp (front) of the upper. The shoe was fairly straight-sided narrowing to a squared, blunt toe. The upper is pleated at the toe to accommodate this square shape. The insole and upper were joined by a seam around the outer edge and the insole was then joined to a welt (a narrow strip of leather) which now only survives for the heel area. The heel portion of the upper, sole and insole is missing but the sole and insole indicate that it had a heel - this may have been made of stacked leather or wood. The stitching on the sole lay within a stitching channel which can still be seen on the outer surface of the worn sole.

From the photos, it looks like there are fine inclusions in the clay and, possibly, traces of a red slip coating on the surface.  If this is the case, then it may well be from Italy - these are not very common in this country, and usually of poorer quality than this when they do occur.  The form, however, looks quite well developed and is more akin to those produced in northern France. I would, however, expect French products to be made of a typical pure white clay.  Also, the northern French products usually have a pattern number and/or manufacturers mark on the socket, rather than just floral decoration.  So, its origin is a little uncertain, but I would certainly favour southern Europe if it can be shown that there are fine sandy grains in the fabric and traces of a slip coat.  It looks like it would have been quite a well made pipe originally and something that was a bit different and 'exotic' in its day.In summary, this is an interesting imported piece and one that does not fit into the normal pattern of imports found in this country.  Datewise, these socketed bowls were being introduced in France in the early nineteenth century and appear here from around the 1830s or 1840s onwards.  Given the uncertainties over the exact origin of this piece, its hard to be sure of the date, but I would have thought that c1840-1900 ought to cover it.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.003645,51.482875],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/3a5f637d-bccd-44b9-8ce7-5d45fe18bb5c","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"JETTON","id":542685,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/542685","description":"An anonymous copper alloy Nuremberg jetton with illiterate legends.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.006898,51.483433],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/7b423af6-d67b-44aa-aeee-d36d759606be","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"TOKEN","id":542512,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/542512","description":"Four biface lead tokens:-1.

The stem is solid and the bowl is hollow but has a large slot at the front of the bowl extending down the base of the bowl and dividing the spur foot into two rectangular tabs. There is a strip of overlapping metal at the upper end of the slot just below the rim of the bowl. Inside the bowl are the remains of some river mud and small pieces of coal. There is some damage to the end of the stem and it is difficult to determine the original length of the stem but it seems likely that this was the original length.

Neither have anything similar and cannot suggest a function.David Higgins writes: \"It's particularly odd having what appears to be a mounting slot in the front since, if anything, you would have expected any sort of a 'display' item to be mounted from the stem end, with the bowl sticking out, especially as its a three dimensional form. That is to say, if mounted, then the bowl end ought to be 'sticking out' into fresh air, like part of a statue, when thestem end would be the obvious mounting point. Similarly, if it were part of a decorative design mounted on a surface, such as a scene from the end of a ship, then ought to have been cut in half so it could be mounted flat.\"David later adds: \"I have had a reply back from a colleague in the Netherlands (Felix van Tienhoven, a member of the Acad�mie Internationale de la Pipe and specialises in the study of metal pipes) who independently suggested the 'display sign' option for the pipe, with the slot being for a wooden mounting. My only concern on this front is that there does not appear to be a pin hole for a nail/bolt to hold it in place if this were the case. As I noted to Jacqui, the fact that the spur appears to have been bent slightly suggests that this is wrought rather than cast iron.\"","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.016366,51.487107],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/8af07d57-b5cc-42e5-bcf0-ff6f8e79959f","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"CLOTH SEAL","id":538946,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/538946","description":"An incomplete Post Medieval lead alloy cloth seal, known as an alnage seal, probably dating to the early 17th century.

This pick has been constructed using the tip of an antler tine.  There is a cut surface across the butt and there is a triangular chip missing; this is probably post depositional damage.

There are very distinctive cut marks which indicate a flint tool was used to cut the tine and work on the hole.  There is some wear and polishing around the hole which is related to the movement of the haft.  The polishing around the tip would partially be natural wear and tear from the deer and partly use/wear as a pick.  There are scratches along the length which also show the working of the tool.There are currently twenty nine prehistoric antler picks in the Museum of London's collection of which only two are firmly identified as being Mesolithic (the rest being Prehistoric or Neolithic).

This is a circular seal box. The base has four circular holes in the bottom ; one central and three arranged around the edge. The three holes around the edge are filled with iron corrosion. There is a hinge cast integrally with both the base and the lid; on the base there are two perforated lugs and on the lid there is one perforated lug which fits between the two lower lugs and an iron pin passes through all three to hinge them. There are traces of iron corrosion surviving in the perforations. There are two notches in opposing sides of the base. The front surface of the lid has a moulded ridge around the edge and in the centre there is a high relief bird showing its chest, wings slightly unfolded, and its head turned right. The bird has been cast separately with a stud on the reverse which passes through the top of the lid. The reverse of the lid show where the stud has been flattened so it is nearly flush with the lid.Similar examples are recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database e.g. WMID550 - only other complete example of a circular seal box with an eagle. HAMP-156A74,BUC-9FE4D2, GLO-D15AD4 and GLO-B305D6 are just the lid with the applied eagle. These other examples show that this design was a relatively popular one, rendered with varying levels of proficiency, perhaps with different consumers in mind. However, the construction of this seal box lid, with a separately rivetted (zoomorphic) motif, is relatively uncommon for the object type. A similar artefact was excavated at Frocester, however, this example had a stylised leopard riveted onto the lid instead of a bird, this dated to the 3rd century (Price, 2000, 55, 56). A second parallel was excavated in London and currently resides in Colchester Museum, this example was dated to the 2nd century (Price, 2000, 55). Andrews (2012:17) writes \"Circular zoomorphic seal-boxes (C2D6) are also generally considered to date from the Neronian & Flavian period running in to the early 2nd century.\"Dimensions: length: 25.43mm; thickness: 10.03mm; diameter: 20.23mm; weight:6.95 g.Colin Andrews (2012) has recently established that seal boxes were used for sealing bundles and bags rather than documents, probably for bags of money though perhaps other precious objects. Andrews (2012:108) writes \"This research project would suggest therefore that seal-boxes seem to have been designed to facilitate the sealing of cloth or leather bags rather than wooden stylus tablets and that this was their primary function We should no longer think of them as 'objects associated with written communication' but rather as objects primarily associated with trade and the economy.\" He continues (2012:109) \"However the evidence presented here would seem to suggest that seal-boxes were primarily used as 'tamper-evident' devices which were attached to bags and pouches most commonly containing cash or small valuables. They would be particularly useful when one needed to send cash from one place to another as described in the famous 'Octavius' letter found at Vindolanda (Tab Vindol II, 343). This association between seal-boxes, cash, and trade, might explain why they seem to have fallen out of use in the second half of the 3rd century A.D. It could be argued that the economic and political crises of those years inhibited the movement of cash and valuables thus making seal-boxes redundant.\"Reference: E Price, 200, Frocester: A Romano-British Settlement its Antecedents and Successors; Volume 2, The Finds, Gloucester and District Archaeological Research Group.Andrews C. 2012.

The mount has been cast in the style of a heraldic crest with a standing boar facing right stood on a twisted rope. The boar has a crown around its neck as a collar and a chain running down the back. There is also a crescent on the shoulder. There is some wear to the body of the boar but there are traces on the legs and underside of the boar of cast marks to represent bristles/fur. One ear is broken and missing. In heraldic terms the crescent is a form of cadency used to indicate this badge was used by the second son. On the reverse there are three rivets for attachment. Each of these rivets appears to have an integral rectangular plate which has been soldered onto the body of the mount. The surface of the reverse is irregular with pitting and seemingly marks of where the molten metal was poured into the mould and set.The Museum of London has lead alloy boar badges in the collections. These have an integral pin for attachment. Spencer (1998:288-9) illustrates one example no. 281h a badge of a boar, bristled and membered. This example is similar to the above but it is not stood on a length of twisted rope nor does it have the collar of a crown. Spencer (ibid.) writes \"Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III) took the white boar as his cognizance. Differenced only by a change of colour, this badge probably derived from Edward III...In 1483, royal wardrobe accounts show that thousands of boar badges were hastily ordered for use at Richard III's coronation in July, and again for the investiture of his young son, Edward, as Prince of Wales in September.\"This mount is in the style of livery badges which would be worn by retainers and household servants to show their allegiance (Spencer 1998:278). Spencer continued \"the badges identified their wearers as persons who were formally attached, or in some way beholden, to a particular magnet (or to the King himself) and who in return enjoyed their lord's protection or patronage\". However the device was often chosen by the wearer and the same device could be simultaneously be used by different families so it can be hard to accurately identify the family or individual. Spencer (1998:279) notes that retainer's badges with devices were in fashion by the mid-14th century and continued in some households into the 17th century but they were at their peak in the second half of the 15th century during the dynastic struggles of the Houses of York and Lancaster.Smith (1990) mentions the tomb of Ralph Fitzherbert in Norbury, Derbyshire (d. 1483) where there is a stone effigy wearing a livery collar comprising two straps (one over each shoulder) which meet in the centre of the chest. At the junction of the two straps, just above a buckle there is a boar badge pendant, also collared and chained. Along the straps are alternate rose and sun mounts (rose en soleil) indicating Yorkist allegiance and the boar is the white boar livery badge of Richard III. Smith (1990) explains the livery collage consisted of a strip of leather, silk or velvet set with mounts in gold, silver or latten, ending in two buckles linked by an ornamental trefoil from a badge could be suspended.Similar boar mounts/badges are also recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database for example, SWYOR-1781B2 and LEIC-F17145 - both appear to have the remains of pins or rivets on the reverse for attachment and are also copper alloy examples, however they do not have the crown collar.  YORYM-1716A4 and LEIC-A6C834 are silver gilt examples and the recorders note that the symbol of the white boar was used by Richard III's household and followers between the 1470's and 1485.  LEIC-A6C834was found during the 2009 survey of the Battle of Bosworth (AD1485).  A similar badge was also found at Middleham Castle, North Yorkshire and is now housed at the Yorkshire Museum.  None of these examples have the crown collar.Dimensions: length: 36.98mm; width: 50.42mm; thickness including pins: 7.43mm; thickness not including the pins: 3.86mm; weight: 19.58g.References: Spencer, B. 1998.

The sides have bands of decoration which starts with a band of repeated triangular motifs; then a wide band of star-shaped indentations; at the bottom of this band before the next band of decoration there are two maker's marks, both the same, comprising an isoceles triangle with three pellets arranged around the peak; they resemble small trees.  The next band of decoration comprises alternate annulets and triangles with lines separating them.  Underneath this is a hunting scene showing running deers amongst trees being chased by dogs.  There is a pelleted border above and below the hunting scene and then finally the band with annulets and triangles is repeated.A silver thimble with a similar hunting scene is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art accession no 10.135.3 it is dated 1577 and is probably from Nuremberg, Germany.  The style of the two thimbles is very similar although the precise detail of the decoration is different.  Holmes (1988: 3) writes that thimbles with  hand-punched indentations often have a maker's mark which is struck  where the spiral of indentations begins near the base.  These would  appear to have been imported mostly from Nuremberg, under the ordinances  of the Guild of Thimble makers, all thimbles and sewing rings were  required to carry the mark of the master who made them.

There are similar circular projections along the deck.  On the left side along the bottom there is a line of ring and dot motifs.  On the base there is a long, thin, flattened section forming a narrow stand.  A section of rigging and part of the right hand side of the ship is broken and missing and there is a crack along the middle of the ship.  Of the second ship the frament includes a mast with rigging down each side reaching down to the deck.  There is a scalloped edge along the bottom of the mast and the rigging presumably marking the edge of the deck.A toy ship with similar masts and rigging is illustrated in Forsyth & Egan (2005:323) no. 10.17, however the body of the ship is solid and the stand is a different shape.  This published example is described as a three-masted warship dated 1660 - 1675, suggesting a similar date for the two ships above.

A curved plate, resembling part of a shoe-horn, went down inside the shoebetween the shoe and the man's heel, while a bar, bent over the upper edge of the shoe, came down outside the leather, and in this specimen had a screw-hole at the bottom of the bar for a screw to tighten it to the leather. From the upper part of this bar projects a short curved neck, carrying a five-pointed rowel, about an inch in diameter. There are several of these spurs to be found in continental museums, though I am not aware of another in England. There is one in the Musee d'Artillerie in Paris, described as English. Zschille and Forrer give two examples as having been used in Germany, and I know of another in Italy.

The grain weights illustrated tend to have a lion passant counter stamp rather than the lion rampant as on this example.  The authors continue later in the book (1993:333) to write that for the lion rampant stamp \"all of the examples seen so far have come from one punch.

This toy copies the shape of a functional frying pan being circular with an extended handle so it could be safely held over an open fire (Egan & Forsyth 2005:117).  There is a looped terminal at the top of the handle, it is decorated with a twisted rope motif and there is an acorn-shaped terminal projecting from the top.  The loop is again imitating the full-sized version which typically hung from a hook when not in use.    The handle is decorated with a moulded pattern comprising alternate ring and dots with diagonal lines, perhaps representing a twisted rope motif.  There are two circular knops at the junction between the handle and the brackets, again decorated with ring and dot motifs.  The frying pan has two brackets which attach the handle to the pan.  There is a fleur-de-lys terminal projecting from the base of the handle between the two brackets.  This terminal is bent over and now lies flat against the back of the handle.  The brackets are decorated with a twisted rope motif extending along the length of the brackets.  When the frying pan was discovered the handle was bent back against the pan.  The finder straightened it shortly after discovery.  One of the brackets is no longer attached to the handle.The circular pan is slightly distorted by damage.  The centre of the pan is decorated with a double rose of five petals and the points of the calyx extend beyond and between the petals.  The inner petals of the double rose are rounded while the outer petals are wider and have indented centres, created two lobes on the outer edge of each petal.  There is a ring and dot motif between each calyx, located just above each indent in the centre of the petals' outer edge.  A wide band of foliate design surrounds the central motif.  A maker's mark is contained within this foliate band; it is directly aligned with the plane of the handle.  The mark shows the letters ID over Q within a plain oval cartouche.  There is a pellet above the ID and one to the right of the Q and one to the left of the Q.  There is an annulet between the I and the D.  Some of the toys with a similar mark within the Museum of London's collections also have date stamps which cover 1640 - 1646 (Egan & Forsyth 2005:47).   The rose and foliate border are both contained within double concentric circles.  The upper part of the bowl is plain.  The rim is decorated with a twisted rope motif.  This motif extends around the majority of the rim but it is missing for a small section between the two brackets of the handle.  The rim in this section is plain and undecorated.Egan & Forsyth (2005:303 no. 8.144) illustrate a very similar object described as a single pierced ear porringer.  On this published example the ear is missing leaving two stubs remaining decorated with a twisted rope pattern.  The bowl of the porringer is decorated with am almost identical pattern to this frying pan.  There is a slight variation in the maker's mark in that it doesn't appear to have the annulet between the I and the D; it seems to have a pellet instead.Reference: Forsyth, H. and Egan, G. 2005.

The inner part of the border design touches the chapter ring which is marked with the Roman hours I-XII with pellet half-hour marks. The dial centre is enclosed within another pellet border; this centre is again openwork with a scroll in each quarter, divided by central cross. The cross has 3 pellets at its centre; one in the centre and one adjoining on the vertical arms; these pellets may indicate that these lines represent the hands of the clock. On the outer edge directly above XII on the face is a loop imitating the attachment loop of a pocket watch. This is now bent. The toy measures 57.8mm (length) x 50.4mm (width) x 2.0mm (thickness) and weighs 10.01g.Forsyth and Egan (2005, 338) date toy watches to c.1625 to 1800 AD.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.059077,51.499012],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/6a8fa2b4-02ba-4c7c-b91b-16a26f264652","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"HOOKED TAG","id":478734,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/478734","description":"A Post Medieval copper alloy hooked tag.

Though there are no surviving documents to prove that permission was granted, the existance of a number of dies cut by John Roettier and now in the British Museum, London, suggests that it was.Just four months later on 11th December, King James II fled England during the 'Glorious Revolution', resulting in the immedate cessation in the production of plantation tokens. None have yet been discovered in the colonies suggesting that these tokens never left England.Eric Newman (1964) identified seven obverse dies and seven reverse dies used in the production of plantation tokens, however this coin is too corroded categorise.

These elements are grouped together by bracket, consisting of a silver strip of three conjoined circles bent into a U, with the two ends (once) joined by a silver rivet above the figure's head; one end of the bracket is now detached, though the rivet is still in place. Looking at the object so the detached side of the bracket its showing, the individual elements can be described as follows:The upper-third of first element takes the form of a naked female bust, with her head in quarter-profile (left), though much of her facial features are worn away. At her shoulders and hips there are pairs of rounded projections; these might suggest limbs, but are probably just decorative. Midline on her waist is a raised roundel. The middle third of the first element is broadly flat in plan, with three raised linear mouldings (a larger one between two evenly sized smaller ones) below. The lower third of the first element is flared, widening top to bottom, with the end bent over at right angles, inwards, to form both an implement, and a possible clasp to the set. The back of the first element is flat and undecorated. The second element is broken, at the point parallel to neck height on the first element. Both faces of this element are flat and undecorated. The third element is a silhouette of the first. Its lower third is however in the form of a lozenge, and was presumably used as a tooth/nail pick. Both faces of this element are flat and undecorated. The fourth element is of the same form as the first element, but reversed (so that the bust on both sides faces outwards). The upper and middle parts of this element are broadly the same as those on the first, but there is no surviving roundel at the figure's waist. The lower third of this element is broadly flat in plan with a small bowl at its end, to form an ear-scoop. The reverse (inside side) of this element is flat and largely undecorated, apart from the inscribed letters SD (presumably the owner's or maker's mark), between the neck and the waist of the bust. The bracket (described above) is decorated with incised lines in the form of chevrons. From the bracket are two silver rings, forming part of an attachment chain.Discussion: Another, similar 17th Century cosmetic set was found in Gloucestershire, GLO-5FB557.  The individual elements are also similar to other silver cosmetic implements recorded on the Portable Antiquities Scheme database of the 17th century; see NCL-B5BCC7 for example.Dimensions: Total length 81.5mmLength of attachments 57.7mmDiameter of ring 11.5mmWidth of attachments 8.4mmThickness of attachments 7.2mmLength of bracket 10.3mmWidth of bracket 6.0mmThickness of bracket 5.5mmWeight 10.58g","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.07445,51.503085],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/0caebcdd-eaf5-400d-8ece-5510895b6830","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"COIN","id":461084,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/461084","description":"A very worn and corroded copper alloy as of Nero dating to the period AD 64 to 67.

The buckle frame is D-shaped and has been carved in one piece with the buckle plates. The pin pivots on a dowel; the end of which is visible on one side only. The frame has a notched pin rest and is decorated with carved diagonal lines. These diagonal lines are overlain by concentric V-shaped lines around the pin rest. There is a front and back buckle plate, all carved in one. There are two rivet holes for attachment. The corner of the front plate is broken across one of the rivet holes.A very similar buckle was excavated from Jedburgh Abbey (Lewis & Ewart 1995:83-4). This excavated example has a similar construction and decoration but does not appear to have the V-shaped variation around the pin rest and it is also made from horn rather than bone. It is dated to the 12th century. A further similar buckle, also made from bone, has also been excavated from a deserted medieval village at Goltho, Lincolnshire (MacGregor (1985:104-5). This buckle is again of similar construction but the decoration varies again with the V-shaped engravings around the pin rest but not the diagonal lines around the rest of the frame; there are also engraved lines forming a border around the front buckle plate.

This particular EE mark turns up in London quite a lot, althgouth examples they are also known from Herefordshire.

The sherd has been made in the fine, bright orange-red fabric associated with Samian-ware, and is very hard. It has been tempered with an extremely fine quartz and has few inclusions. The vessel has been covered with an orange-red slip. On the reverse of the sherd, the lower half of one small element of moulded decoration is visible in the uppermost field.

The fragment consists of a bone scale with a D-shaped section that would have comprised one hemispherical half of an oval-sectioned knife handle. It is difficult to estimate how long the handle would have been as one end of the fragment is broken. The other end appears to have been the finished terminal of the handle as it has been shaped into a flat outer edge, with a gentle curve into the upper face of the handle. The handle has been decorated with an incised geometrical pattern that divides into three panels running along the length of the handle. This would have been a way of easily dealing with the potential difficulties of decorating the curved handle. The central of the three long panels has been filled with pairs of striations at ninety degrees to the length of the handle. On either side of this panel is a thick incised border, below which on each side the field has been filled with a cross-hatched design. MacGregor (1985, 170) notes that such cross-hatching design is commonly encountered in knife handles from the Post Medieval period, as it serves both a decorative purpose and a functional one, as it improves the grip of the handle. On the reverse of the fragment, the flat face of the bone has not been decorated. At the outer edge opposite the terminal, the fragment steps down sharply just before the break, and this may indicate where the material had been shaped to accommodate the tang of the knife-blade. The fragment is in good condition and is a buff-biscuit colour.Dimensions: length: 39.64mm; width: 18.53mm; thickness: 8.35mm; weight: 6.71g.Reference: MacGregor, A. 1985.

The buckle has a double-loop frame that has been cast with a D-shaped section and a flat back. Each of the oval loops has a wide outer edge, and a bevelled inside edge. From the upper and lower outer corners of each loop projects a rounded knop. Here, the buckle was poorly finished after casting, and small projecting tabs of metal that spilled over during the casting process have not been filed off. The loops narrow slightly as they curve inwards towards the strap bar, which is on the same plain as the loops and undecorated at the upper and lower edges of the frame with a small pointed knop. A pin would have been wound around this bar in order to fasten the buckle, but this is now missing. The reverse of the buckle frame is undecorated and fairly corroded. The buckle frame has a golden yellow patina, but is fairly covered with a black coating, which is a decayed organic substance likely to be Linseed oil. The Linseed oil survives in thick patches also on the reverse of the frame. Egan (2005) illustrates a number of similar buckles, pp.34-35, most notably ref. 77 which has black coating.Notes: Egan (2005, 16) dates the fashion for coating metal objects with linseed oil to the late 15th century, and suggests it remained popular until around 1550.

The find consists of a corner fragment from a large Roman brick, probably a lydion or a pedalis.  The tile has been made using an iron-rich clay heavily tempered with grog and quartz; the fabric has not been mixed evenly and these tempers gather in large striations. The fabric also contains a large number of air bubbles. The front surface of the brick has been decorated with a swirling pattern that was incised by the maker with a fingernail whilst the clay was still plastic. Such marks made pre-firing are usually known as signature marks, but they tend to be a small hemisphere or symbol, and restricted to one area of the brick. This decoration seems to cover the entire surface of the brick, and therefore is more likely to be a kind of graffiti than a signature mark. On the reverse of the brick, along with the two edges of the find where the sides of the object remain intact, a large amount of Roman mortar remains in situ.

The width of the scabbard chape indicates it would have served for a dagger rather than a sword. The chape has been made out of folded sheet with a soldered seam. It is 26.7mm wide at the top opening, and tapers downwards from here until it forms a point. A collared knop cast in a different copper alloy has been soldered onto the lowest point of the chape; it is 7.7mm in diameter. Towards this point on one side of the chape, the letters XI (if the chape points from left to right) have been incised near the upper edge. The chape?s copper alloy sheet is quite worn and thin, and has given way in places. At the opening of the chape the sheet is intact as it is supported by a layer of organic material preserved inside. This is probably the remnants of the leather scabbard. Here the artefact is approximately 7.6mm thick. Tests for iron on this area proved negative, and so no part of the dagger blade remains. The surface of the chape has a red-brown patina. The scabbard chape is a hybrid of the styles represented in Egan (2005), as it has been formed out of sheet but has had a cast element added with solder. Generally, however, Egan notes (2005, 192) that chapes were fashionable during the 16th century but had diminished in appeal by around 1600. \tDimensions: length: 79.5mm; width: 26.7mm; thickness: 7.6mm; weight: 11.58g.Reference: Egan, G. 2005.

There is a stacking scar on the body and there is some modern damage to the edges.  A similar vessel is illustrated in Hurst, Neal and van Beuningen (1986:197-8 no.94.308) which is identified as an oil pot from the 16th century.

This tankard is of stave construction and the handle has been carved integrally with one of the staves. The upper edges of the staves have been cut at an angle to create a narrow edge to the rim; it is the inner surface that is angled. The handle has a rectangular cross-section and the top and outer edges are shaped with notches to create a decorative profile. The staves are held together with two iron bands which are riveted closed. One of the iron bands is broken across a perforation which suggests the iron band may have possibly been reused. On the base the letters \"RH\" have been carved. There are no other markings on the body or base of the tankard. There are two peg holes in the handle for the articulation of the lid. The lid is no longer present. The fill was excavated in the Museum of London conservation lab and there was nothing significant contained within. Rebecca Lang. Conservator, suggests the staves appear to be oak and the handle beech.Similar examples have been found on the wreck of the Mary Rose and Marc Meltonville also believes this example is most likely connected to ships. Marc also notes that coopers do not carve an integral handle this is a different technique to one that coopers would use. The tankards found on the Mary Rose are of a similar stave construction but they have willow hoop fragments rather than the iron on the above example. In total 27 wooden drinking tankards were found distributed throughout the wreck suggesting they were in use throughout the ship. The authors (2005:450-2) note that most of the tankards are made up of elements of different woods, though pine is the most popular for the staves. Most have markings and many of these are based on the broad arrow and cross, perhaps indicating official provisions. These tankards had lids and evidence of pitch lining.Hazel Forsyth notes a capacity of 3 pints suggests that it was used as a decanter rather than a measure. The lid is missing but objects of this type and date are exceptionally rare and this vessel is in a very good state of preservation. So far as I know it is the only one of its kind from London soil. Shakespeare doesn't refer to 'tankards' in his plays but the word 'pot' crops up from time to time - so perhaps there is a link there.Dimensions: height: 220mm; diameter at base: 162mm; diameter at top: 112.48mm; weight: 1806.2g (with some mud still attached the wood waterlogged); capacity: 1850ml to top (3.25 pints)Reference: Gardiner, J. and Allen, M.

The one-piece comb has been formed from a single piece of ivory, possibly cetacean bone given that the comb was crafted in one piece and that the teeth had to be aligned with the grain (MacGregor 1985). The comb is double-sided, with the scars for a set of coarse teeth on one side of a central reserve and a set of fine teeth on the other, a few of which are now missing. The elliptical section of the comb means that although the teeth are slender in profile, from front to back they are considerably wider. The central reserve has a crude incised decoration on front and back, with a circle containing a geometric, six-petalled flower at the axis between the central reserve and end, and an empty oval at the middle of the central reserve. The boundaries of the central reserve are not symmetrical; the fine teeth meet the reserve in a straight line, but where the coarse teeth have been carved out, the boundary of the central reserve slopes, so that the reserve tapers toward the end section that is now lost. The remaining end section of the comb is narrow, undecorated and tapers toward the side with the coarse teeth. One laminated sheet of the ivory has been lost at this corner.

The handle then widens sharply out into what would have been a polygonal reserve with three decorative incised lines and a number of fine teeth. Sections are missing on both sides of the remaining reserve so we cannot tell how large this would have been. The size would have been constrained, however, by the choice of material, as the teeth of the comb would have had to follow the grain of the ivory; Hazel Forsyth suggested in this case the material is elephant ivory. The artefact was probably a functional comb or tool rather than being used in the hair, as it seems the fine teeth would have extended considerably from the rather short handle. The handle itself is more suggestive of the rounded handles of toilet implements, or various pegs, but the teeth make these interpretations unlikely.

The fine tooling on front suggests age and the working at the back, together with uneven outline, suggests that it has been hand cut not stamped. The button was submitted as medieval but has been passed by the curator of medieval collections to me as a post-medieval object. I do not have a parallel for it, although the use of composition in this way is found on gold dress fittings submitted through the Treasure Act, such as TAR 2002, no. 174 from Bletchingdon, Oxon, there dated to the late 16th or early 17th Century, and that may be the right date range for this button.

The piece measures 00mm in overall length, 00mm in width and is 00mm thick; it weighs 00g. It comprises a long slender iron dagger housed within an ash-wood sheath. Both are in a reasonable state of preservation although the dagger's organic hilt-plates and pommel, and the sheath's suspension loop(s) and chape, are missing. Initial cleaning of the surface corrosion products on the sheath in the laboratory by Rebecca Lang has revealed negative traces clearly demonstrating the former existence of a series of overlapping ? copper alloy strips decorated with bands of repouss� dots. (It is possible that these strips copied leather originals.) X-rays have also revealed the positions of a number of pins arranged in a broadly linear fashion down the back of the sheath, by which means the now-missing decorative strips were presumably secured. A further series of three narrow ? iron bands clasp (rather than encircle) the sheath, and these may have been the means by which the missing suspension loop(s) were attached. The sheath itself appears to have been constructed of two separate slender plano-convex 'leaves' of ash wood, effectively bound together by the (missing) overlapping ? copper alloy strips. It is hoped that further conservation work will be able to confirm both this and other constructional details. The Chambers Wharf dagger can be added to a small group of late Hallstatt examples, all but one of which were probably recovered from the west London Thames (Jope 1961; Macdonald 1978). The single outlier, from Luttre in Belgium, may be a British export. As a group, these daggers are usually dated to the 6th century BC; it is possible that radiocarbon dating of the Chambers Wharf sheath will be able to supply independent corroboration.","organisation":"Portable Antiquities Scheme"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.066129,51.501176],"granularity":{"tolerance":{"value":1,"units":"km"}}}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/hfa_pas_london/847e5a4a-1c8b-435d-ae0c-d6db084c9556","type":"Feature","properties":{"title":"VESSEL","id":82297,"url":"https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/82297","description":"Three sherds representing the lower wall/base of a round-based bowl with an external zone of finger-tip/finger-nail decoration, combined weight 121.79g.
